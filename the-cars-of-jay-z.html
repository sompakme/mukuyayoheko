Still, Jay-Z got prominent artists to make guest performances, including Mary J. Blige, The Notorious B.I.G. and Memphis Bleek. It featured songs like “Ain’t No Nigga” and “Can’t Knock the Hustle.” It had Mafioso rap themes and gritty lyrics about the lifestyle of a young black man.</p><p>Critics commended the work as a crowning achievement. It has been ranked as one of the top 500 albums of all time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-blueprint><b>The Blueprint</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p>In 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album called “The Blueprint.” The album was released in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy, thus relegating the success of the record to the background. Still, it went on to be certified as double platinum and the album has since been considered a classic in the annals of hip hop.</p><p>Eminem featured as a guest performer in the song called “Renegade.” The album featured both mainstream and hardcore rap, thus allowing it to attract a wider audience. Jay-Z provided Kanye West with a break in this album by allowing the latter to produce four of the 13 songs. The album included hits like “Rizzo (H.O.V.A.),” “Girls, Girls, Girls,” “Jigga that Nigga” and “Song Cry.” The album is also ranked as one of the top 500 albums of all time.</p><p>He holds the record for the most number of albums by a solo artist to have topped the charts, with 12 of his albums getting to number one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=other-ventures><b>Other Ventures</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jay-Z also owns the hip establishment called 40/40 Club. He is also a part owner of the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA. He is also the founder of Roc Nation and the co-founder of Roc-a-Fella Records. He also has his own clothing line called Rocawear.</p><p>In 2008, he married<a title="The Cars of Beyoncé Knowles" href=#> Beyoncé Knowles</a>, an extremely successful artist in her own right. The two’s union make them one of the richest celebrity couples in the world. They are so rich that Beyoncé can afford to give her husband a $2.6 million Bugatti Veyron as a gift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=bugatti-veyron-grand-sport><b>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport</b></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p>The Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport is a longitudinal, mid-engined car that was developed by the German-based Volkswagen Group and made by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. in Molsheim in France. It has a permanent four-wheel drive and seven-speed DSG sequential transmission. It is powered by an 8-liter W16 quad turbocharged engine that can develop a total of 1,001 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute. The car has a targa top. With the roof on, it can go at a top speed of 252 miles per hour. With an open top, the car is limited to only 217 miles per hour. Car experts have described the Bugatti Veyron as simply the best car that has ever been made and the greatest car that we can see in this lifetime. Aesthetics- and performance-wise, it has practically no peer. At around $2 million, only the rich and famous can aspire for it. And Beyoncé and Jay-Z fit that mold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=maybach-57s><b>Maybach 57S</b></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p>The Maybach 57 came out after the Maybach branc was revived by Daimler Chrsyler AG. The car is based on the Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan. While it has been ranked ahead of the Rolls Royce and Bentley in terms of quality and performance, its sales lag in comparison as it sells only about 20 percent of the numbers posted by Rolls Royce. As a result, production of the vehicle is expected to terminate in 2013. Whether this would further boost up the price of the car because of its limited edition factor or not remains to be seen.</p><p>The Maybach 57S was launched in 2005 in Switzerland before it was introduced in the United States in 2006 during the Los Angeles Auto Show. The S in the car model’s name stands for “Special.” The car features a 6-liter V12 Mercedes AMG engine. It has a power output equivalent to 450 kilowatts and can produce up to 603.5 horsepower and 738 lb ft torque. It can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-s-class><b>Mercedes Benz S-Class</b></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p>The Mercedes Benz S-Class was used by Jay-Z and Beyoncé when they went around Paris.
