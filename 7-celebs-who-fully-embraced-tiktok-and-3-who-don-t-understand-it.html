It seems like they might be missing out on all the fun! TikTok allows users to edit, crop, and manipulate video footage in very cool ways. Users can add filters, text, sounds, and anything else they want to add to make their content appear super cool and enticing.&nbsp;Several&nbsp;celebs have embraced the joy of TikTok and deserve to be followed as soon as possible!</span></p><h2 id=embraced-kylie-jenner><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Kylie Jenner</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a>&nbsp;has fully embraced the world of TikTok… the same exact way she embraced social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter. At first, she was floundering on TikTok since she was only posting boring content about her cosmetics line. She quickly figured out that to be successful on TikTok, she needed to post funnier content. She posted a lot of funny videos with her friends and some of them even poked fun at her older sisters.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=embraced-ashley-tisdale><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Ashley Tisdale</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ashley Tisdale has 5.4 million TikTok followers who have liked her content 59.7 million times. Her page is filled with dancing videos which makes a lot of sense because her bio says, “</span><span style=font-weight:400>I’ve got moves you’ve never seen.” Well, we believe her! Ashley Tisdale still knows her moves from her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High School Musical</a> days with Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens.</span></p><h2 id=doesn-t-understand-mila-kunis><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Doesn’t Understand: Mila Kunis</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mila Kunis is fully anti when it comes to social media. It just doesn’t interest her. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, she said, </span><span style=font-weight:400>"[The internet] took an ugly turn and became all about who can be the loudest, who can be the angriest and the most negative. Then it’s just not a fun game to play.” Social media really has caused a few problems with self-esteem issues of the younger generation over the years since it became so popular so Mila Kunis’ opinion isn’t too outlandish.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=embraced-ashley-benson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Ashley Benson</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ashley Benson, who is currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating rapper G Eazy</a>, is embracing the TikTok game more than ever these days. She played the role of Hannah Marin on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pretty Little Liars </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>alongside Shay Mitchell and Lucy Hale. On TikTok, Ashley Benson posts funny content with her friends and even shows off her fashionable side!</span></p><h2 id=embraced-ariana-grande><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Ariana Grande</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a> hasn’t posted a lot of content on her TikTok just yet, she is already getting the hang of it and embracing the app, much to her fans’ delight. With only two visible posts so far, she already has gathered 18.7 million followers and 34.1 million likes.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What To Expect From Ariana Grande’s Next Album</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If she is already doing numbers like these, there is no stopping her from her popularity growth on the social media platform.

She told Elle, </span><span style=font-weight:400>"It wouldn’t be a positive thing for me. If people can handle that sort of output and input in the social media sphere, power to them." It is unfortunate that Emma Stone doesn’t care to stay connected with her fans on social media because she would easily rack up the followers. She stays busy with her career as an actress so social media is not her top concern.</span></p><h2 id=embraced-demi-lovato><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Demi Lovato</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Demi Lovato is an interesting celeb to follow because she has been through some major highs and lows in her life… like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her recent engagement that got called off</a>, for example. She keeps it real and is always open and honest with her fans about her life. Following her on all social media apps, including TikTok, just makes sense.</span></p><h2 id=embraced-katy-perry><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Katy Perry</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a> has been making her fans smile for years. Since her first single “I Kissed a Girl” premiered in 2008, she has been really living it up and thriving.

I’d rather that people had less access to my personal life." Even though she had that opinion many years ago, she still stands by that same way of thinking today. She still has not downloaded TikTok… or any social media app for that matter.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=embraced-miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Embraced: Miley Cyrus</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a> is one of the most beloved celebs since her Disney Channel days as Hannah Montana.
