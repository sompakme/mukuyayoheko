We love that song, so we thought we’d reimagine it a little bit. We had a lot of fun with it.”</p><p>As for her costume, the Grammy winner revealed that her only request was to have “Stevie Nicks hair” so that she could <a href=#>channel the legendary Fleetwood Mac singer</a> with her ghostly getup.</p><p>Clarkson previously opened up about her love of Halloween, telling guest <a href=#><strong>Michael Ealy</strong></a> on Wednesday, October 26, that <a href=#>she indulges in some of her kids’ candy</a> after they go trick-or-treating. “I totally steal their candy while they’re sleeping. They go to bed and I find my favorite things and I’m like, ‘That’s mine,'” she said with a laugh. “They don’t remember. I’m like, ‘Oh, I guess you didn’t get that. I guess it didn’t make it into the bag.'”</p><p>After the Fatale star, 49, revealed that <a href=#>he also has a habit of stealing his kids’ candy</a>, Clarkson joked, “They’re not that smart yet!”</p><p>The “My Life Would Suck Without You” songstress has frequently <a href=#>opened up about raising kids River, 8, and Remington, 6</a>, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong></a>. “I tell my kids this all the time,” Clarkson revealed on her talk show earlier this month. “You’re each other’s buddies. <a href=#>Especially cause we went through divorce, right</a>?”</p><p>She continued: “So they go to their dad’s and mine. So anytime you travel, you’ve always got each other. …<a href=#> I always try and make them, like buddies when they fight</a>. I’m like, ‘No, no, no. This is your wingman. You’re supposed to stick up for each other. Don’t tattle tale all the time.'”</p><p>Clarkson and Blackstock, 45, were <a href=#>married for nearly seven years before she filed for divorce</a> in June 2020. <a href=#>Their divorce proceedings were finalized earlier this year</a> after nearly two years of contentious court battles. The “Miss Independent” singer explained to Variety that as the parent with primary custody of the little ones, she decided not to “hide everything” about the divorce from them — even when it’s hard.</p><p>“Obviously, don’t talk about stuff that you shouldn’t talk about, <a href=#>but it’s OK if they see you cry, or it’s OK if they see you’ve had a bad day</a>,” Clarkson told the outlet in September. “You start to feel that kind of shame, like, ‘I’ve got to put my best foot forward as a mom because I don’t want them to be affected.’ But then you allow your kids to express empathy, and they learn how to say, ‘Oh, man, I’m sorry you had a hard day.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the time, the Texas native also revealed that <a href=#>she plans to channel a lot of her emotions surrounding the split into her upcoming album</a>. “The whole divorce thing happened and I needed to write it,” Clarkson explained about the process of writing about the breakup. “And then I didn’t know if I was going to release it, because you can be very angry in that state of mind. So, some of the songs, they definitely cover the gamut of emotions; there’s everything on the album. It’s almost like the arc of a relationship, because the beginning is so beautiful and so sweet, and then it evolves. And sometimes it doesn’t evolve how you want.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more photos from Clarkson’s Halloween special:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktaK4y6iunp2eYn9xfpFmop6knK56pLjAq6Ksp55isbOx0qycrGWRqHqprdSnq56cXajBpsLInmSnoZOgwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-the-family-background-of-matt-araiza-meet-his-parents-rico-araiza-and-kerry-araiza.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside The Family Background Of Matt Araiza: Meet His Parents Rico Araiza And Kerry Araiza</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brooke-elliott-net-worth-how-much-is-brooke-elliott-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brooke Elliott Net Worth How Much is Brooke Elliott Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
