The graphic, 10-minute video, directed by controversial visionary, <strong>Romain Gavras</strong>, left many viewers stunned and was pulled from YouTube for its violent imagery. Soliciting such a heated reaction, some might find it ironic that the concept started off as a joke.</p><p>“We [had] been talking about [the idea] since the start of the year, [but] I didn’t think she’d actually do it,” says&nbsp;<strong>Christopher “Rusko” Mercer</strong>, M.I.A’s lead producer for her as-yet-untitled third album. “It was one of those joking ideas where people would beat the shit out of me because I was ginger [a natural redhead]. It has a whole double meaning. The gingers are kind of anyone who’s been oppressed. She’s so deep and crazy political.”</p><p>The English producer also explained to VIBE that the video’s shock-value mirrors that of M.I.A.’s forthcoming album. “Her record is going to scare people I think. We went a bit crazy – really, really, really left. But then again if you’re an M.I.A. fan, you want to be surprised and be like ‘Whoa, what the hell is that?'”</p><p>Rusko, who says he and M.I.A. wrapped up the album in Hawaii, shared details on what fans can expect&nbsp;sonically.<span id=more-52355></span></p><p>“We stood in waterfalls recording with microphones. We recorded her kid’s heartbeat and cracking ice – really experimental,” he says. “We recorded 20-minute jams of me on the computer with my synthesizer and M.I.A. trying different lyrics and singing styles. Then we just pieced it together afterwards. We wanted it to have a live feel. Almost like [there was] an electronic band behind her.”</p><p>Though Rusko says M.I.A. is still delivering her usual “everything’s fucked up” spiel, the new wife and mother will also be showcasing a surprisingly softer side. “There’s two or three different mentions about her baby and her new fellow as well. It’s not all ‘Fuck the world.’ There’s a track made out of power drills and electrical tools, which sounds like craziness and then there’s a song with a piano and organs in it,” he says. “I figure a beat made out of chainsaws is just as surprising as a love song with M.I.A. singing beautifully. Both are not what you would expect.”</p><p>Rusko is currently prepping for his debut album,&nbsp;O.M.G, set for release May 4.&nbsp;M.I.A.’s third album is scheduled to drop on June 29. —Tracy Garraud</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>Cultural Critic Toure Defends M.I.A.’s ‘Born Free’ Video</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K2onnPq6adrZOav26uzqulZp6imrJuwsidnKhlo6mus8DEnWSjp5uaeq%2Bx1maYpZqlonq4tculZKybkaeybrzEqKelnV1qf3SBlGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-foufas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Foufas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-fans-stings-wendy-williams-over-auto-tune-comment.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonce Fans Stings Wendy Williams Over Auto-Tune Comment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
