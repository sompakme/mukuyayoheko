As artists&nbsp;stay cooped in their rooms with crafts on their minds, art lovers come crawling in packs to Joann's door. And with investors clambering to e-commerce sites like Etsy and Shopify, where vendors frequently pursue the chain for material, Joann sees a promising future in light of the company's opening for public trade. The key to Joann Fabrics' sudden resurgence: the onslaught of demand for chic, homemade face masks.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Luxury Japanese Ski Resorts Anticipate Post-COVID Recovery</a></span></p><p>"While JOAN lost $546.6M in its fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2020 (i.e., before the pandemic began)," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeking Alpha</a> reports, "preliminary numbers show that the chain made $210.9M to $212.9M in the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, 2021."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Covid-19 began and the nation's <a href=#>mandate made masks mandatory</a>, online retailers saw a huge market for producing unique, stylish masks for the masses.</p><p>Fundamentally there has been a shift for people who want to do more do-it-yourself projects," Wade Miquelon explains to Fortune in regards to the influx of DIY projects in households due to the pandemic.</p><p><strong>Etsy to the Rescue</strong></p><p>Face masks soon became a prominent selling point for stores like Etsy, where they made up <a href=#>14% of total gross merchandise in 2020.</a>&nbsp;In a recent article, Forbes highlighted Michigan retailer, Kimberly Hamlin who sells masks for brides on her Etsy store <a href=#>KimsVintageDesigns</a>.
