For his audition, he performed a song by the Black Crowes titled “She Talks to Angels,” which scored him a four-chair turn from the judges.</p><p>“Huntley, I was hearing …. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of an English singer called <strong>Daniel Merriweather</strong>. There was another guy called<strong> James Morrison</strong>. I’m hearing this tone, like the<strong> Chris Stapleton</strong> thing, that’s a tone that comes naturally,” <strong>Niall Horan</strong> said while trying to convince Huntley to join his team. “I bet you were singing like that when you were 15. You sing your own way, you sing very direct and [with] so much power and the control that you have. It’s so beautiful to listen to.”</p><p>Fellow coach <strong>Gwen Stefani</strong> gushed about Huntley’s talent as well, adding, “Your voice is just so automatic. You know exactly at what point you’re going to be raspy and it’s pure and honest. You sound like you’ve been singing forever. You’re just comfortable.”</p><p>Huntley received praise from <strong>Reba</strong> and <strong>John Legend</strong> before he chose Horan as his coach. He made it all the way to the finale on Tuesday, December 19, where he performed alongside contestants <strong>Jacquie Roar, Ruby Leigh, Mara Justine </strong>and<strong> Lila Forde</strong>.</p><p>Before his victory, Huntley reflected on the <a href=#>outpouring of support</a> he’s received from viewers and fans throughout the season.</p><p>“This is insane. So blessed and so grateful for everybody that has believed in me on this journey. This Monday my friends and I will put on another live show to showcase what all of us have been working so hard towards,” he wrote via Instagram on Sunday, December 17. “Even though someone will be crowned a winner, we’ve all just been trying to create moments of genuine artistry and the amount of support from all over has meant so much to all of us.”</p><p>Huntley concluded: “We’ve had contestants ranging from 13 to 50 years old, people from so many different walks of life. It’s been such a bonding experience and all of us have grown from it. I really can’t thank the voice enough for putting this group together. 🙏❤️🤟.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Huntley following his win on The Voice:</p><h3>When Did Huntley Start Singing?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/History-With-Music-Michael-Huntley-Instagram-Who-Is-Huntley-5-Things-to-Know-After-the-Singer-Won-Season-24-of-The-Voice.jpg><p>According to his bio, Huntley’s interest in music began at a young age.
