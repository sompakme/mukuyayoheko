Yet, when it was first announced that the film adaptation of Helen Fielding novel Bridget Jones's Diary had cast a Texan actress, not everyone was on board with it.</p><h2 id=why-nobody-wanted-an-american-cast-in-bridget-jones-39-s-diary><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Nobody Wanted An American Cast In Bridget Jones's Diary</span></h2><p>Bridget Jones is said to be a quintessentially British heroine, which is why fans of the book and some media outlets in the UK were concerned when Zellweger beat British actresses for the role.</p><p>Helena Bonham Carter, Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz, as well as Australian star Toni Collette and more were considered for the part, which ultimately went to a Texan actress who wasn't exactly a big name at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the early 2000s, Zellweger had starred opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire and Chris O'Donnell in The Bachelor, <a href=#>as well as Jim Carrey in Me, Myself & Irene</a>, directed by the Farrelly brothers. Arguably, the role of Bridget skyrocketed Zellweger's popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, earning her an Oscar nod and BAFTA nomination, meaning that the Brits, too, were ultimately sold on her portrayal of Bridget.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Before Winning An Oscar, Renee Zellweger Was An Extra In This Classic Movie</a></span></p><p>"There was a whole scandal about why isn't this a British actress? I didn't know Renée Zellweger, and a Texan playing a British character, it did seem like a stretch," Bridget Jones's Diary star Hugh Grant said in the 2020 documentary, Being Bridget Jones.</p><p>After he had met her, however, Grant said Zellweger was "bang-on" and that the film would be a "triumph".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bridget-jones-39-s-diary-director-instantly-knew-zellweger-was-the-one><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bridget Jones's Diary Director Instantly Knew Zellweger Was The One</span></h2><p>Despite knowing that she may face backlash, director Sharon Maguire thought Zellweger was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the perfect fit for the role of Bridget</a>.</p><p>"I figured that when [the right actress] walked in the room, we'd know," Maguire told Total Film in October 2000.</p><p>"She did walk in the room, and we did know. And we went, 'Oh f**k, she's a Texan.'"</p><p>“She's got this inner irreverence, and she's got this innocence and vulnerable exterior," the director also said of Zellweger.</p><p>"She also has a very good sense of physical comedy and was so dedicated to getting it right. When I first met her, she said: 'If you and I get this wrong, we're so busted.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film premiered in 2001 to positive reviews, proving that taking a chance on Zellweger paid off.</p><h2 id=zellweger-didn-39-t-know-there-was-criticism-about-her-casting-in-bridget-jones-39-s-diary><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Zellweger Didn't Know There Was Criticism About Her Casting In Bridget Jones's Diary</span></h2><p>Ahead of the film's premiere, its leading lady <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was largely unaware of the casting controversy</a>.</p><p>To prepare for the role, Zellweger worked incognito as an intern at London publishing house Picador-Macmillan, where she would perfect her British accent and get acquainted with the minutiae of Bridget's own job.</p><p>"There were a couple things that I picked up closer to the time we filmed because part of my job or 'work experience,' as they said, at the publishers was to clip any clippings in the media that had to do with the authors that Picador-Macmillan represents," the actress said in a Role Recall interview with Yahoo! in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Picador represented Bridget Jones author Fielding, Zellweger had to clip articles about the writer and her novel's film adaptation.</p><p>"So every now and then something would pop up and I would see 'Cr*p American Comedian Playing English Icon,' and I'd have to cut it out and go put it in the file," she recalled.</p><p>"I thought it was just a tiny little thing.

I knew she was a brilliant actress, and I knew she had all those lovable, slightly victimy qualities that you need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But I just know from experience that accent-wise, even if you're an accent genius, crossing the Atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way. So I was a little scared for her."</p><p><a href=#>Zellweger trained with Barbara Berkery</a>, the vocal coach who prepared Gwyneth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love. The Chicago actress then put her English accent to the test during her work experience at Picador.</p><p>"Accent-wise she had a very brief Princess Margaret phase, which was alarming!" Grant said.</p><p>"Then there was a brief phase where Renée sounded as though she … had a stroke! You know, everything was rather slurred. But then Renée knocked that on the head. And two weeks before we started shooting, her accent came perfectly into focus.</p><p>"It's the best American doing English that I’ve ever heard in my life. And not once did she stop speaking with that accent, until the wrap party. When suddenly this weird.....Texan appeared.
