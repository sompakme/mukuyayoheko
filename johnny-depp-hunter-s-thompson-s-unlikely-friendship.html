One of the most inspiring and glorious examples of this kind of unconditional friendship is the one between <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> and journalist Hunter S. Thompson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>13 Craziest Things Johnny Depp Has Done For Roles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hunter S. Thompson founded the movement of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gonzo journalism,</a> a new age or reporting that required subjective viewpoints in order to achieve objectivity. This resulted in several monumental books including the debut <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hells Angels</a>, the critically acclaimed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>, and the political masterwork, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail</a>. Whether his subject was at outlaw biker group, the President of the United States, or himself, the result was always a monumental literary effort that pushed the field of journalism into uncharted territory that resulted in both praise and voracious criticism. It is then no surprise that Thompson and his cinematic counter part <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> would get along so famously, as Depp's career seemed to mimic aspects of Thompsons. Depp portrayed his characters with an element of personal attachment that allowed the audience to feel as though they were getting to know the man through his pretend portrayals. His cynicism, purity, and chaotic good demeanor brought him into the spotlight, and, into the hazy-tinted shades of Hunter S. Thompson.</p><h2 id=the-films>The Films</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The dynamic duo first met when Depp, a fan of Thompson's work, went to the Woody Creek tavern in Aspen, Colorado to meet Thompson at one of his local watering holes. Both of the avant garde icons were from Kentucky and shared the same southern sentimentality of misunderstanding. Legend has it, Thompson entered the bar with an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">electric cattle prod and taser</a>. Shortly after, the duo got along famously. They went back to Thompson's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Owl Farm</a> and shot shotguns, built bombs, and launchd bombs they shot with guns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The duo then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went to Cuba together</a> after Depp received phone calls at all times of the night. The relationship continued and by 1997, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp was living in the room across from Thompson's War Room</a>. During their time as roommates,&nbsp;Thompson wrote articles on his meeting with Bill Clinton, his impressions of George Bush, and published countless articles with Rolling Stone. Then, Depp agreed to play the fictionalized version of Thompson, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raoul Duke</a>, in the 1998 feature film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</p><p>Depp's passion for the partnership stemmed beyond the role and ultimately led to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Depp convincing Thompson to publish The Rum Diary</a>, Thompsons only novel. Depp would later go on to portray the semi-autobiographical character in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feature film adaptation</a> in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp also paid homage to his surrogate family member through the animated feature film <a href=#>Rango</a>. The story was partially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired by Thompson's works</a> and alluded to his influence throughout. It was the third film that Johnny Depp starred in that honored his friend Thompson.</p><h2 id=the-friendship>The Friendship</h2><p>The friendship between the two cult-classic icons stemmed well beyond the feature film collaborations and mutual influence and respect. Together, the duo could be seen traveling throughout Colorado and Los Angeles at cultural staples like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Viper Room</a> alongside other celebrities <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including John Cusack</a>. The duo took trips together, both to physical locations and on drugs within the compound Owl Farm. They shared ideas for films, concepts for books, and talked about being two of the most misunderstood monsters of culture to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thompson would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">refer to Depp as Colonel</a> and when the two were apart, they would talk on the phone constantly, hatching plans for future travels in bizarre coded language that only meant something to&nbsp;one&nbsp;another. During the filming of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shaved Depp's head</a>, the ultimate baptism in the Freak Power movement. Together, the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shot 12-gauge shot guns</a>, built a variety of explosives, launched fireworks, and rejoiced in the rebellious nature that stems from freedom. Depp was also given access to some of the more private journals of Thompson during this phase, some of which he said made him come across as gentle, humble and honest, while others seemed to showcase that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a stripped down version</a>&nbsp;of the true carnal chaos that emerged during Thompson's search for the heart of the American dream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-funeral>The Funeral</h2><p>As a final farewell to the great gonzo journalist, Depp fulfilled some of Hunter's final wishes. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taking his own life in 2005</a>, stating he had lived <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 years longer than he had ever wanted or anticipated</a>, Depp chose to memorialize the master with a ceremony that included launching Thompson's ashes out of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">153-foot Freak Power inspired cannon</a> while "Hey Mr. Tambourine Man" by Bob Dylan blasted through speakers. The funeral was a swanky send off in true Thompson fashion, a celebration that cost Depp a reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The event was attended by several cultural icons including: <a href=#>Sean Penn</a>, <a href=#>Bill Murray</a>, <a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a>, Senators <a href=#>John Kerry</a> and George McGovern, <a href=#>Lyle Lovett</a> and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band who performed alongside a series of Tibetan drummers. The event took place <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2005</a> and solidified both Thompson and Depp as two of the most bizarre, influential, and defining characters of the 21st century.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Might Join Marilyn Manson's Band</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyRecord</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meaww</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MSN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StarsInsider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MasterClass</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYSWritersInstitute</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGuardian</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNp7BmnJWlvW601KernqpdqHq1tM6mp6ynnmLCr7jIpJylsV2bv6qxzZ2qoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shannen-doherty-filed-for-divorce-after-husband-s-affair-exposed-before-her-brain-surgery.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shannen Doherty Filed For Divorce After Husbands Affair Exposed Before Her Brain Surgery</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jacques-azoulay-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jacques Azoulay Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
