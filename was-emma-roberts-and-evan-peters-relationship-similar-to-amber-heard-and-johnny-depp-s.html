Let's take a look at that relationship and what went on between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-roberts-and-evan-peters-have-a-bumpy-history>Emma Roberts And Evan Peters Have A Bumpy History</h2><p>Roberts and Peters started to date back in 2012 when they met on the set of 'Adult World'. Of course, working alongside one another would continue in 'American Horror Story'. Eventually, the relationship would start to turn south, with Roberts getting arrested in 2013 for giving Peters a bloody nose.</p><p>It was said according to TMZ that Roberts also looked as though she had scratches on her legs, <a href=#>nonetheless the situation was swept away by Roberts and Peters' reps</a>, issuing this statement.</p><p>“It was an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding,” Roberts and Peters’ reps told Us Weekly at the time. “Ms. Roberts was released after questioning and the couple are working together to move past it.”</p><p>In addition, Peters would refuse to press charges following the encounter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Julia Roberts Tried To Take Emma Roberts Away From Her Father</a></span></p><p>From then on, it was a very on and off style of relationship. The two got engaged only to call it off and then get back together. Recently, Roberts faced another heartbreak, breaking it off with Robert Hedlund. It is believed that having a child during the pandemic created extra stress for the two.</p><p>Going back to Roberts and Peters, it is interesting to note that both sides have stayed very quiet about their time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-roberts-has-kept-quiet-about-her-past-with-evan-peters>Emma Roberts Has Kept Quiet About Her Past With Evan Peters</h2><p>"I never want to talk about relationships I'm in or that are ending or have ended. It's hard enough to be with someone by yourself, let alone with an audience," she said.</p><p>Yes, Emma Roberts tends to be very private when it comes to her relationships. According to the actress, social media has not made things easy for actors in her type of situation.</p><p>"Growing up is hard. Sometimes it makes me sad that I can't have a private moment. Because of Twitter and Instagram, there's a whole other element where everybody can comment on what you're doing and no one knows the real story," she continued. "I think I know what's true, and I know what happened in my own life and so do the people who love me and who I love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Much Talked About Emma Roberts Feud Was Totally Fake</a></span></p><p>Roberts might be hinting at the fact that not all stories from the media relating to her breakup are accurate, but she seems to be okay with that, given she knows her truth.</p><p>Roberts would further say that life is filled with ups and downs, <a href=#>but it is all about managing those emotions.</a></p><p>"I think that no matter who you are or what you do or wherever in the world you are, anything ending is hard. Losing something is hard."</p><p>"I'm realizing that life is highs and lows. I'm trying to ride them out and live somewhere in the middle. When you're low, you think it's never going to end. When you're high, you're so scared of it ending. And I've lived in both of those places for too long."</p><p>Ultimately, it seems as though her relationship was much different in comparison to Amber and Johnny's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-breakup-was-said-to-be-civil-than-johnny-depp-and-amber-heard>The Breakup Was Said To Be Civil Than Johnny Depp And Amber Heard</h2><p>Some fans might be quick to label these relationships in the same category however, that would be completely wrong. Verbal abuse was especially harsh in the Depp and Heard relationship, along with several physical altercations between the two. Aside from one instance, there really wasn't a history of physicality or verbal abuse between Emma and Evan, it just seems like two stars who were younger at the time and filled with emotions.</p><p>In addition, it is said that when the two finally broke up for good, they did so on amicable terms... clearly, that was not the case for Johnny and Amber, nor will it ever be.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>When Did Amber Heard And Johnny Depp First Kiss?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqWRYr%2BwrsSrq6xlkaOxbrHVmqVmqJWpsrO%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2armaK2ra3RZquoZZGir6a%2BjKGcmqqUYq6vsIyjpqGmnq56pbHPqWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-lewis-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aaron Lewis Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-hynes-and-hunter-king-tease-hallmark-kansas-city-chiefs-movie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tyler Hynes and Hunter King Tease Hallmark, Kansas City Chiefs Movie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
