Besides starring in Fever Pitch, he played Dennis Hope in Almost Famous and starred in movies ranging from Whip It to Factory Girl and Arthur and the Invisibles. He has also played a version of himself in several movies, such as Jurassic World and Ted 2.</p><h2 id=what-is-nancy-juvonen-39-s-job-like>What Is Nancy Juvonen's Job Like?</h2><p>Flower Films have produced many romantic comedies starring Drew Barrymore, which of course makes sense.

Flower Films is also behind The Drew Barrymore Show, the talk show that has been on the air since 2020.

She has no social media accounts, which her husband has mentioned on his own Instagram, and she doesn't seem to give many interviews. However, she is always all smiles when shown on her husband Jimmy Fallon's social media. Drew Barrymore, in contrast, has spoken a lot about Flower Films, which makes sense since she's a public figure.</p><p>In an interview with Marie Claire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barrymore talked about Flower Films</a> and praised Juvonen.</p><p>She spoke about working with her and said, "There were so many women before me who helped pave the way for me to be a female producer. I don’t think that me and my partner, Nancy Fallon, went into it thinking, 'as females we’re going to take this opportunity and kill it'. We went in as hardworking producers and we killed ourselves to earn a seat at the table, and to earn the trust of the studios."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nancy-juvonen-jimmy-fallon-kids.jpg><p>Barrymore shared that they worked with a female studio head behind Charlie's Angels which made things easier.</p><p>She continued to Marie Claire, "we never felt like we were fighting to be in this boys’ club.

In 2014, after becoming a father, Fallon said during an episode of The Tonight Show, "The truest thing I can say is... sometimes you just know. But that’s terrible advice. The only people who say that are the people who just knew. How do you know unless you found that person? I think you just look for the person you have the most fun with. And that’s enough."</p><p>Fallon added during the episode, "You realize, “Wait, I can just keep having fun with her forever?” Yes, you can do that.
