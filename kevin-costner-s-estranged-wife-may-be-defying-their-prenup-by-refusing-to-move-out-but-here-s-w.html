But she may also feel as though she put her career on the backburner to care for their three children, whereas Kevin has continued to make movies regularly. He’s also currently the star of the hit show Yellowstone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given how much Kevin is worth, one would expect that Christine would walk away from their divorce with a generous settlement, especially since they’ve been together for nearly 20 years. After so long, it’s clearly not a marriage of convenience or merely for money.</p><p>However, Christine agreed to a strict prenuptial agreement before their wedding, which now entitles her to a little more than $1 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Kevin Costner's First Divorce Became One Of The Most Expensive In Hollywood History</a></span></p><p>Specifically, the prenup says Kevin must pay Christine $1 million in the case of divorce. It doesn’t appear this figure is influenced by the number of years they remained married. Conversely, in many prenups, the divorce settlement is higher in longer marriages.</p><p>While $1 million is a lot of money, it pales in comparison to Kevin’s net worth. Specifically, it’s less than 1 percent of Kevin’s net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned, Kevin also has to give Christine a little under a quarter of a million to go towards her new home plus pay the insurance and taxes for the first year. He also must help her with rent until then, and it’s expected he’ll pay a significant amount in child support for their kids.</p><p>But still, it appears that the prenup won’t require him to pay more than $2.5 million in total to his estranged wife, which would still only represent 1% of his personal fortune.</p><p>Although Christine agreed to the prenup, its terms don’t seem fair. There’s a possibility she didn’t fully understand what she was agreeing to at the time, or perhaps she truly believed they’d never divorce, and it wouldn’t be an issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin was reportedly insistent on signing the strict prenup because of what happened in his firs divorce from actress Cindy Silva. The pair were married from 1978 to 1994 and share three children. When they split, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">court awarded Cindy an $80 million settlement</a>, making it one of the most expensive divorces in Hollywood.</p><p>When he walked down the aisle again a decade later, Kevin apparently wanted to prevent a similar situation from happening.</p><p>Although Kevin may not have to pay Christine an $80 million divorce settlement, things have already gotten messy, and all this drama may not be worth the price, figuratively at least.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoLK3tc1mmqirpKOys7%2BMnqqtqpGjtKawjLCgn51dp7KnwdKeqmasn2K6sMLEZqaurF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-seo-hyun-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lee Seo-Hyun Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-what-kobe-bryant-s-life-looked-like-before-the-nba.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What Kobe Bryant's Life Looked Like Before The NBA</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
