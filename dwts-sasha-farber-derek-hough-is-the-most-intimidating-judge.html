He’s always got this stone cold look and then [his score] could be, like, really bad. [Or] then he’s like, ‘That was great.'”</p><p>The Russian-born dancer joked, “It’s just his face.”</p><p>The Utah native, 37, <a href=#>made his official debut in the DWTS ballroom</a> during season 5, competing with <a href=#><strong>Jennie Garth</strong></a>. The twosome were eliminated in the semifinals, landing in fourth place. (Derek’s sister <a href=#><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a> took home the mirrorball trophy that year with partner <a href=#><strong>Hélio Castroneves</strong></a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sasha-Farber-Why-Derek-Hough-Most-Intimidating-Judge-DWTS.jpg><p>While he left his inaugural season empty-handed, <a href=#>Derek went on to make DWTS history</a> with a record-breaking six wins. Some of his victorious partnerships included <a href=#><strong>Brooke Burke</strong></a> in season 7, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Grey</strong></a> in season 11, <a href=#><strong>Amber Riley</strong></a> in season 17 and <a href=#><strong>Bindi Irwin</strong></a> in season 21.</p><p>Derek <a href=#>appeared on 17 seasons of the ABC hit</a> before his final run in 2016. After a four-year break, during which he judged on NBC’s <a href=#>World of Dance</a>, the Emmy winner returned to DWTS to sit in for <a href=#><strong>Len Goodman</strong></a> since the 78-year-old was <a href=#>unable to travel to the Los Angeles studio</a> at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Fans were surprised by the tough love Derek showed the competitors during season 29, but the pro exclusively told Us he simply wanted to see each dancer excel. “I had no intention to be tough or anything like that, but I guess what I realize, for me, is that I think I just have a lot of respect,” he explained in October 2020. “I have a lot of respect for these celebrities and what they’re doing and I genuinely want to give them some feedback. ‘Cause I know for me when I was a pro, I wanted actual feedback. I want to learn how to be better. So that’s what I’ve always wanted to do.”</p><p>The Hairspray Live! star insisted that <a href=#>he would “never be mean” to anyone on the show</a>, adding, “I will be honest on certain things because my intention is I really, genuinely want them to be better.”</p><p>Derek was tapped to judge again during season 30 and is <a href=#>currently doling out scores each week</a> on season 31. Farber has been performing with <a href=#><strong>Selma Blair</strong></a> — but he’s keeping a close eye on ex <a href=#><strong>Emma Slater</strong></a>‘s partner, <a href=#><strong>Trevor Donovan</strong></a>.</p><p>“There are definitely a lot of dark horses, and Trevor came in this competition being afraid to dance,” Farber told Us. “That’s, like, the main thing you wouldn’t do if you’re afraid to dance, is do a dance show. And he’s firing on all cylinders. He’s doing phenomenal. … The best dancer doesn’t always win. It’s a race, and it’s long. It’s a marathon. So, I think everyone has their own little advantages and disadvantages.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs on Disney+ Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuwrKNiwKK%2Fx5pkn5mil7KzecOeqZ6jXZ28trPHZqCsZaSdsm65zqyrZqGeqbautcOaq6Kml2K3trDGnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmy-fallon-s-wife-nancy-juvonen-has-an-even-cooler-entertainment-career-than-him-but-does-she-hav.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Fallon's Wife Nancy Juvonen Has An Even Cooler Entertainment Career Than Him, But Does She Hav</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-lara-flynn-boyle-predict-her-career-downfall-in-an-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Lara Flynn Boyle Predict Her Career Downfall In An Interview?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
