(Bloodline, a new original series from Netflix, stars Butz alongside <strong>Kyle Chandler</strong>, <strong>Linda Cardellini</strong>, and <strong>Sissy Spacek</strong>, among others.)&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, what I hope Katie ends up with is the guy that is totally out of the business who is, I don't know, some phenomenal house painter or something out in the 'burbs [and] who is also an artist," Butz, 48, said of the Ohio native.</p><p>Any other criteria? "He should be able to dance, because she's a fabulous dancer," the actor added of the Dawson's Creek alum, 36, who memorably performed a <strong>Judy Garland</strong> tribute on a 2009 episode of Fox's So You Think You Can Dance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Holmes needs "someone who can scoop her up and do a tango with her 'cause she's a fierce dancer," Butz told <strong>Us</strong>. "She needs a man who can get her on the dance floor."</p><p>The Giver actress was of course famously married to <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> — with whom she has an 8-year-old daughter, <strong>Suri</strong> — from 2006 to 2012. She has not seriously dated anyone in the public eye since their divorce.</p><p>Butz, for his part, is married to his former Wicked costar <strong>Michelle Federer</strong>, with whom he has a 4-year-old daughter, Georgia. He also has two kids from a previous marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSesm60zqWknqtdqLWwwcudZJ2ZpJp6onnGq5yarF2Zrq%2BvxKtkp6eil7KzwIylnKhlkqrBu3nSmrCsZWJlfnaCkmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristen-kish-bio-age-height-family-husband-career-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristen Kish Bio, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Career and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./j-holiday-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J Holiday Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
