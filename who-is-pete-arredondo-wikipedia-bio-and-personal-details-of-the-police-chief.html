He received public scrutiny because of poor decision-making in response to the incident.</p><p>Before officers entered the rooms and killed the attacker, the attacker was in two adjacent classes for more than an hour. As per the policy for active shooter scenarios in which the police are taught, they are supposed to end the immediate threats.</p><p>However, Pete, who was said to be the commander that day, delayed taking down the shooter and instead tried several keys in nearby classrooms to find the master key to the room where the gunman was holding the kids and teachers hostage.</p><p>Many believe that if law enforcement had acted quickly to the situation, the 19 children and two educators might not have lost their lives tragically. But instead, the supposed commander waited 77 minutes to recuse the children and educators.</p><p>Pete does not have a Wikipedia bio, but he spent roughly three years as a police captain at Laredo’s United Independent School District before joining the Uvalde school district in early 2020.</p><p>He oversaw the north half of the Laredo school district and was third in command at the Webb County Sheriff’s Office. He had a brief stint as a detective. He spent 16 years in various positions with the Uvalde Police Department.</p><p>He had served as the school district’s police chief since March 2020. However, he took a leave of absence from his position in June. Moreover, he also submitted his resignation to the Uvalde City Council, which was accepted on July 12.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-pete-arredondo-have-a-wife></span>Does Pete Arredondo Have A Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pete Arredondo has been in the headlines since the incident at Texas high school. However, his personal details are still confidential.</p><p>Thus, there is no information regarding his wife or any immediate family members. Nonetheless, it is believed that he is a family man.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-pete-arredondo-age-more-on-his-family-details></span>What Is Pete Arredondo Age?- More On His Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The family of the Texas mass shooting victims has been demanding the board fire, Pete Arredondo. Finally, after three months of outcry, the school board unanimously decided to do so.</p><p>Arredondo did not attend the conference, but his lawyer presented a 17-page press statement in which he claimed that the district had not acted legally in moving to remove Arredondo and that he was worried about his safety as he had been receiving death threats.</p><p>His attorney, George Hyde, said that a letter from the district suspending him without pay does not qualify as an official “complaint” required by law to consider termination, reports&nbsp;CNN.</p><p>On the other hand, Pete has denied that he was the commander on-site that day. Instead, he argued that his approach to the incident was responding as a police officer and did not title himself commander.</p><p>The 50 years old has been fired from his position at Uvalde School. His contract has been terminated. He was at the age of 25 when he first started his career as a law enforcement officer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ypnK2dXZa%2Fs7HDqKWdp12stqy1z56bopldl7awecCnm2aolafAsLrApWSdnaSWtq2%2FjKidZqyYmnqxu8uimp5lk522prKO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-the-new-pinocchio-top-the-original-as-the-best-disney-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will The New Pinocchio Top The Original As The 'Best Disney Movie'?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phoenix-man-murders-his-family-on-christmas-day-hours-after-caroling.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Phoenix Man Murders HIs Family on Christmas Day Hours After Caroling</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
