He was 25 years old.</p><p>At a wrestling event at Tremont Music Hall, wrestlers said they were in shock at Reid Flair's death.</p><p>They rang a bell 10 times in his memory to say goodbye.</p><p>George South, another wrestling legend who used to wrestle with Ric Flair, said he had trained Reid Flair for the past five years.</p><p>On Twitter, Flair wrote he had been wrestling in Tokyo and planned to wrestle with his father in Maryland this weekend.</p><p>"Just the prime of his life, to be taken," South said. "I just hurt for the family ... He was just a great, great kid."</p><p>Police would not release many details about Fliehr's death but said foul play does not appear to be involved.</p><p>In 2009, Flair was charged with felony drug possession, but police would not say if drugs were involved in this case.</p><p>Former training partner Jake Feuerbach said he saw Flair about a month ago and said he seemed determined to conquer his problems.</p><p>"The last time I saw him, he was clean and sober," Feuerbach said.</p><p>He described Flair as outgoing and humble.</p><p>"I remember Reid getting in a car with me and helping me set up a ring and sweep out a ring before everybody else was even in the building," he said. "That's the person I remember."</p><p>The Flair family released a statement through Ric Flair's agent, saying: "We are heartbroken to confirm that Ric's son, Reid Fliehr, has passed away today March 29, 2013 in Charlotte, NC. The investigation into the cause of death is ongoing. Reid was 25 and an incredible son, brother, friend, and professional wrestler. No words can describe the grief that Ric and his family are experiencing and they do request privacy during this devastating time."</p><p>Feuerbach described Flair as a smiling goofball on the brink of some of the success his father was so well-known for.</p><p>"I think he was really close to turning the corner and doing something special and standing on his own," he said.</p><p>The medical examiner will release Flair's cause of death.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">WSOC</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te8%2Boo6KblWK%2Fqq%2BMn6OaoaKoerS7zWadqK2emXqlscCdZKGnpJq5cH%2BSbWpsb2NthHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-man-harrison-net-worth-how-much-is-richard-man-harrison-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Richard Man Harrison Net Worth How Much is Richard Man Harrison Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./magnum-p-i-s-jay-hernandez-says-he-didn-t-love-series-ending.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Magnum P.I.s Jay Hernandez Says He Didnt Love Series Ending</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
