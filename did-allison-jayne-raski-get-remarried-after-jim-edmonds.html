Best known for a pair of plays in which he caught the ball in amazing ways, Edmonds’ career featured lots of highlights. For that reason, Edmonds was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014 which meant that he was joining a truly elite group of world-class athletes. Sadly, all good things must come to an end, which is a saying that is very true for athletes since most sports are dominated by young players. As a result, it wasn’t a surprise to anyone when Edmonds hung up his bat and retired from active play in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, there have been many famous athletes who have struggled to figure out what to do when they aren’t competing. For example, some <a href=#>athletes have given acting a try only to flop</a> and be ripped apart from critics. Additionally, there have been many <a href=#>athletes who’ve embraced “reality” TV and tarnished their image</a>. In the years since Jim Edmonds accepted that his professional baseball career was over, he has stayed in the spotlight partially because he adopted a broadcasting career. On top of that, just like a lot of his peers, Edmonds became a “reality” star which made fans pay attention to his love life. For that reason, a lot of people have been wondering about Edmonds’ ex-wife Allison Jayne Raski and whether she remarried following their divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Reality TV Stars Who Married Actual Celebrities</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-truth-about-allison-jayne-raski-and-jim-edmond-rsquo-s-relationship>The Truth About Allison Jayne Raski And Jim Edmond’s Relationship</h2><p>After many, many years of athletic success, it had become very clear that Jim Edmonds’ athletic career was winding down by the year 2008. On the other end of the spectrum, his personal life seemed to be taking off at the same time as he married a gorgeous woman named Allison Jayne Raskiin 2008. Instead of going all out on an elaborate ceremony, the couple reportedly tied the knot in a St. Louis County Courthouse when Jim was 38-years-old and Allison was 28-years old.</p><p>During their marriage, Allison Jayne Raski and Jim Edmonds had two children together and they built a life together. Sadly, some things aren’t built to last in life and that proved to be the case for Raski and Edmonds’ marriage. After all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raski and Edmonds got divorced after six years of marriage</a>. According to reports, Edmonds and Raski’s children went on to live with her following the divorce but their father remained an active part of their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Tiger Woods' Wealthy Ex-Wife Has Made A Fortune Since Their Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=jim-edmonds-rsquo-other-ex-wives>Jim Edmonds’ Other Ex-Wives</h2><p>Even though Jim Edmonds and Allison Jayne Raski were married for six years, it could easily be argued that their relationship is less talked about than any of the other pairings he has been involved with. Part of the reason for that seems to be the fact that Raski largely seems to have disengaged from Edmonds’ life while he remained close with his first wife. After all, Edmonds' first wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeAnn Horton reportedly attended his third marriage ceremony before she tragically lost her life</a> to cancer in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Jim Edmonds’ first wife LeAnn Horton received a fair amount of attention during her life, his third wife has been talked about exponentially more. After all, in addition to being married to a famed athlete, Edmond’s third wife starred in The Real Housewives of Orange County in the past which helped <a href=#>Meghan King to amass an impressive fortune</a>. After five years of marriage and the birth of their three children, Jim and Meghan went their separate ways in 2019. Almost exactly two years after breaking up with Jim, Meghan went on to marry a lawyer named Cuffe Biden Owens who is the nephew of the current President of the United States, Joe Biden.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Real Housewives Of Orange County: 5 Best Episodes (& Worst) Ranked By IMDb</a></span></p><h2 id=jim-edmonds-and-allison-raski-rsquo-s-current-relationship-statuses>Jim Edmonds And Allison Raski’s Current Relationship Statuses</h2><p>Just like Meghan King, Jim Edmonds has moved on to another relationship since their divorce. In fact, Edmonds wound up getting engaged a fourth time only three months after he and King finalized their divorce. In an awkward twist, the model and real estate agent who accepted Edmond’s proposal reportedly was a close friend of King’s. As of the time of this writing, Edmonds and his fiancée Kortnie O'Connor haven’t walked down the aisle yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the years since Allison Jayne Raski and Jim Edmonds got divorced, she has seemingly actively avoided the spotlight. For that reason, very little is known for sure about Raski’s life these days aside from the fact that she is very actively involved in her children’s lives. That said, from all accounts, it seems like Raski hasn’t remarried as that is the kind of thing that almost certainly would have resulted in headlines. Still, she may be in a relationship since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whosdatedwho.com describes Raski as “possible single”</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Where Is Meghan King's Ex-Husband Jim Edmonds, In 2021?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWRobmqv86nZKOZqaOybr7ArKKiZZ2Wv7O1xJ1ko6GdYrKluc6nm6xlo52upbGMsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hunter-king-nico-svoboda-split-end-engagement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hunter King, Nico Svoboda Split, End Engagement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./when-is-basketball-season-over.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>When is basketball season over</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
