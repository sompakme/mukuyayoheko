He added that he is “OK,” but needs “a week or two to get back on my feet.”</p><p>Original story below:</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jay Leno</strong></a> is being tended to at a Los Angeles burn unit after skipping an appearance in Las Vegas, according to reports.</p><p>“His family was not able to provide us very many details, but there was a very serious medical emergency that is preventing Jay from traveling,” The Financial Brand wrote in an email to Forum 2022 attendees on Sunday, November 13, via <a href=#>People</a>. “All we know is that he is alive, so our prayers go out to him and his family tonight.”</p><p>The former <a href=#>Tonight Show</a> host, 72, was set to take the stage at a financial conference in Sin City on Sunday evening.</p><p>While Leno has yet to comment on the nature of his health scare, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported on Monday, November 14, that the New York native was undergoing treatment at the Grossman Burn Center in Los Angeles after allegedly suffering burns following a car fire.</p><p>The Jay Leno’s Garage star <a href=#>was reportedly burned</a> on Sunday after one of his cars burst into flames at his storage garage in California, according to the outlet.</p><p>The TV personality previously opened up about his health in 2019 after being diagnosed with high cholesterol and seeing a blockage in his heart.</p><p>“We really want people to see the connection, because a lot of people don’t realize high cholesterol — and if you’ve had a heart attack or stroke, you’re increasing your risk for another one,” he said <a href=#>during a Cholesterol 911 video</a> in March 2019. “It’s like an earthquake, it might not destroy the house, but it certainly weakens the structure.”</p><p>Leno continued: “There’s a lot of people walking around like that, they’re just time bombs. You’ve got all this cholesterol, you don’t realize it until it actually hits, you know? It’s like in a car, if even one piece of dirt gets in the eye of the needle of the jet, and boom and no more gas comes through. And that’s what happens with your heart.”</p><p>The comedian explained that he had started to manage his cholesterol by taking medication and monitoring his heart rhythm with a portable EKG device.</p><p>Later that month, the Jay Leno Show alum <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> why he was done with late night talk shows after retiring from The Tonight Show five years prior.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t really [miss it]. I loved it when I did it,” Leno confessed at the time. “But at some point, you can’t keep pretending you know all of <strong>Jay-Z‘</strong>s music. When you get to be my age, [it’s like,] ‘Oh yeah, right, right.’ I’m at the point now where I’m hearing oldies I didn’t hear the first time. That’s an oldie now? I didn’t even hear it when it came out in ’98. No, I missed it. So that’s where it’s at.”</p><p>The Emmy winner — <a href=#>who hosted the NBC series from 1992 to 2009 and then from 2010 to 2014</a> — concluded: “TV is basically a young person’s game. …You do it for as long as you can, and then you hand it off. Handing it off to Jimmy was a great thrill.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Leno’s team for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaliuaa6zmaZrqqemrFutc1mmpqqXZu2s7GMpqCsq5WoeqbCxKerZp6fp3quscOimpqkXZq6pr7GnqWcsV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-fernandez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jessica Fernandez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elton-john-s-lawyer-responds-to-claims-he-groped-bodyguard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elton Johns Lawyer Responds to Claims He Groped Bodyguard</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
