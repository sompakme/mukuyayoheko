But after season two's disappointing run, fans were worried that even more divorce announcements would be coming down the pipeline. Not to mention, would-be couple <a href=#>Kyle and Deepti bummed everyone out with their post-season romance</a> and their subsequent breakup further marred the show's record.</p><p>Very few couples have found marital bliss thanks to Love is Blind, but one couple did beat the impossible odds. Amber and Matt Barnett from season one of the show are still married in 2022, and seemingly very happy.</p><h2 id=amber-and-barnett-got-married-after-season-one-of-love-is-blind>Amber And Barnett Got Married After Season One Of Love Is Blind</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Amber and Matt Barnett (who goes by his last name on the show) <a href=#>admitted that they nearly got a divorce</a> after walking off into the sunset post-Love is Blind, they are still married as of September 2022 and seem to be as happy as ever.</p><p>That said, the couple didn't have an easy go of it while the show was filming, or, really, anytime they got together with their castmates.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly: Everything Love Is Blind Contestants Have Said About The Show">The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly: Everything Love Is Blind Contestants Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><p>Although Barnett chose Amber and proposed to her in the Love is Blind pods, he also dated Jessica, who felt their connection was stronger and more authentic than Barnett's with Amber.</p><p>The drama added some interest to the show, but in real life, Amber and Barnett simply avoided Jessica and life went on.
