The one-off custom built Maybach was revealed in May 2005 at the Tempodrom in Berlin. The built by Stola in Turin is a one-off vehicle designed to showcase the new high tech performance of the Exelero Tyre range from the leading tyre maker Fulda. These two companies have not teamed up for the first time because way back in 1938 Fulda showed its tyres on a Mayback SW 38 limousine. Now there are to produce the model in the series registered for on-road use. This New Exelero will be limited to just 10 pieces having the cost of $8 to $10million dollars.</p><h2 id=maybach-exelero-8-000-000>1. Maybach Exelero: $8,000,000</h2><p><strong>Price</strong>: $8 million</p><p><strong>Country of Origin</strong>: Germany</p><p><strong>Engine</strong>: V12 twin turbo</p><p><strong>0-60 mph</strong>: 4.4 seconds</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The exelero, commissioned by the tyre company Fulda is a chopped-down two-seater coupe. Though it is much more than just a show car. During the tests at the Nardo high-speed oval, the model reached the top speed of 218.38 miles per hour even though it weighed around 2.6 tonnes. It can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 4.4 seconds. The design of the car is the result of the competition among the students at the Pforzheim Polytechnic Department of Transport Design which has designed the show vehicles for Fulda during the past. The designing of the 24 year old Fredrik Burchhard was selected and the entire work was coordinated with Mayback design centre in Sindelfingen. Basing on the Maybach 57 limousine the project required a certain amount of re-engineering: the A-pillar and the doors were to be shifted backwards and the steering column, the pedals and the gearshift had to be relocated altogether. The benchmark 550- bhp v12 engine was prepared for 5.9 litres and tuned for 700 bhp with over 738 lb ft of torque. The final dimensions which were 5890mm long, 2140mm wide and just 1390 mm high the car was packed with a full-spec interior that included leather, neoprene, aluminium and the carnbonfibre finishes. Rapper&nbsp; Bryan "Birdman" Williams, reportedly spent $8,000,000 on the one-off Maybach Exelero coupe. The rapper has a <a href=#>net worth of $125 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bugatti-veyron-supersport-2-600-000>2.

Although Ferrari is yet to announce the price but it is rumored to be more than $2 million.</p><h2 id=zenvo-st1-1-800-000>4.
