The musician, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr, was found unresponsive on a bathroom floor of a friend's home in Los Angeles at around 4pm. EMTs desperately attempted to revive the rapper for 45 minutes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An autopsy is now underway to establish the official cause of death - though authorities do not suspect foul play. According to the star's longtime manager, Jarez, paramedics suspected the <a href=#>father of ten</a> suffered a cardiac arrest. Coolio suffered from asthma for most of his life. In 2016, he struggled to get through a performance at Hilly Country Barbecue Market in Brooklyn. The musician appeared to be struggling with his conditions before a fan provided him with an inhaler.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Coolio Left 10 Children Behind But How Many Baby Mamas Did The Rapper Have?</a></span></p><p>In a 2002 interview with USA Today, Coolio revealed that previous asthma attacks could have ended his life. "I had to realize I had a chronic disease which needs to be treated for as long as necessary," he said. Coolio was a spokesperson for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. It could be the reason why Coolio slowed down in his career and his net worth significantly decreased.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1995, Coolio released the chart-topping song <a href=#>Gangsta's Paradise</a>, featuring R&B singer L.V., for the film Dangerous Minds. The star of the film, three-time Oscar nominated actress <a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer, also appeared in the video.</a> Although Coolio remained in the public eye in his later life with a guest stint on Celebrity Big Brother UK and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reality show</a>, why didn't his massive cultural impact reflect in his pocket?</p><h2 id=coolio-39-s-multiple-child-support-lawsuits-hurt-his-net-worth>Coolio's Multiple Child Support Lawsuits Hurt His Net Worth</h2><p>One of the things that severely affected Coolio's net worth was taking care of his many children. According to records obtained by The Sun, the rapper had at least ten kids - including four with his ex-wife Josefa Salinas. Records revealed the rapper went through <a href=#>three child support battles</a> with ex-partners demanding financial support for their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The LA Department of Child Support Services first filed a child support lawsuit against Coolio in February 1999 on behalf of a woman named Juanita Randle. The case took five years to get to court before the parties eventually settled. Then, in 2010, he was involved in a legal dispute with Taleya White, who is the mother of his child, Darius Ivey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who is a musician</a> just like his late father. The case was eventually dismissed in January 2012, presumably after the "C U When U Get There" artist paid up all his child maintenance.</p><p>In 2010, Coolio's former love interest Annabella Bellesi took him to court in 2010 in a two-year child support battle. She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> at the time that she had to file for child support to prove to the state of California she could qualify for Medi-Cal. The rapper was ordered to pay $300 in child support for then-infant son Christopher Kal El Ivey Bellesi. Legal documents suggested that Coolio was only earning $1,387 per month at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coolio-had-a-net-worth-of-over-1-million-prior-to-his-passing>Coolio Had A Net Worth Of Over $1 Million Prior To His Passing</h2><p>Coolio, had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $1.5 million </a>at the time of his passing, despite consistently touring. Across the summer, he had toured across Europe and the US and even made an appearance at ERA Music Festival in Florida. In the final weeks of his life, Coolio took to stage at 24th Street Stage in Virginia Beach on September 4, followed by shows at Denny Sanford Premier Center in South Dakota and The Caverns in Tennessee.</p><p>Coolio was set to continue his I Love The 90s Tour, with upcoming performances set to take place at Camelback Ranch in Arizona - with Vanilla Ice, Rob Base, Tone Loc and Young M.C - on September 30, and another show on November 18 at the PPL Center in Pennsylvania.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coolio-had-several-tributes-after-his-untimely-passing>Coolio Had Several Tributes After His Untimely Passing</h2><p>Celebrities took to social media to pay tribute to Coolio in the wake of his unexpected loss. 90s rapper Vanilla Ice spoke out about the loss of his friend. Ice - real name Robert Matthew Van Winkle - told <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> he lost sleep over the news. "My heart goes out to all the family. I'm truly devastated. He was a great friend," he told the outlet. The "Ice, Ice Baby" artist added, that he was "still in shock and freaking out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hollywood actress Michelle Pfeiffer, 64, shared the music video for "Gangsta's Paradise" on Instagram. "Heartbroken to hear of the passing of the gifted artist @coolio. A life cut entirely too short." She continued: "As some of you may know I was lucky enough to work with him on 'Dangerous Minds' in 1995. He won a Grammy for his brilliant song on the soundtrack - which I think was the reason our film saw so much success."</p><p>"I remember him being nothing but gracious. 30 years later I still get chills when I hear the song. Sending love and light to his family. Rest in Power, Artis Leon Ivey Jr." Pfeiffer was the star of the film, playing former Marine LouAnne Johnson who goes to work at a high school as a teacher in a rough neighborhood in California.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Rapper Coolio Since Releasing 'Gangsta Paradise'?</a></span></p><p>As well as winning the Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance, Coolio won two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rap Video and Best Video from a Film and a Billboard Music Award for the song/album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rapper Ice Cube took to Twitter after hearing the sad news and paid tribute to Coolio, writing, "This is sad news.
