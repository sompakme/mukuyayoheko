It was during that sad, dark time – after the recent losses of Sherri Martel, Bam Bam Bigelow and the blackness of the Chris Benoit tragedy – I was hearing that Andrew was having drug addiction problems again and I was fearful he might be next.&nbsp; I saw a need to keep in touch with him and do all I could to encourage him to save himself, and maybe some others too.&nbsp; We renewed our friendship and stayed in touch.</p><p>This past November I had the luck of doing a wrestling tour in France for two weeks with Andrew and he seemed to be a new man.&nbsp; He’d completed WWE sponsored rehab and had a new lease on life. Andrew clearly had his demons on the run and we talked about him becoming the poster child for wrestlers that desperately needed a voice urging, “If I can beat this, so can you!”&nbsp; Andrew convinced me he had the commitment and the determination to make a difference.&nbsp; I had a great time with him on that tour.</p><p>Following the tour I had&nbsp; painful knee replacement surgery and now it was Andrew calling me to see if I was doing okay.&nbsp; A few weeks ago he talked of coming to visit me here in Hawaii.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seemed so strong and focused that I never thought to question him about how he was doing.&nbsp; I again urged him to use his experience to reach out to the many wrestlers who are still losing their battle with drug addiction.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I wish so much that I could’ve somehow known that Andrew was losing his grip on his addictions, beginning to slip. I failed to see the signs of him losing a battle that I thought he’d already won.&nbsp; My heart has been heavy since the news of his passing.&nbsp; In our last phone call, a few weeks ago, I kidded him about how he worked that entire France tour and never&nbsp; took one bump and I smile at the memory of his deep booming laugh echoing over the phone. That’s how I choose to remember my friend.&nbsp; I’m sorry I didn’t see his pain and suffering;&nbsp; had I known I’d have tried harder to save him.&nbsp; He slipped and we lost one of the good ones. Nobody has anything but the nicest things to remember about Andrew Martin.&nbsp; I will miss him. He was a dear friend, one of very few I had left in a profession where too many die too young.&nbsp; My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his entire family. Somehow, as&nbsp; hard as we all tried, we lost another good soul forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZhva3JxXZe%2FpsCMoZirrF2sv6rAxKxkmpqfqsFuwMeeZKmZo6i2r7OMqJ1mmZ6Zv6bDjK2crKxdoq6zwMin</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hallmark-stars-pets-a-complete-guide-of-the-actors-dogs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hallmark Stars' Pets: A Complete Guide of the Actors' Dogs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ayesha-curry-health-journey-felt-like-a-competition-against-steph.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ayesha Curry: Health Journey Felt Like a Competition Against Steph</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
