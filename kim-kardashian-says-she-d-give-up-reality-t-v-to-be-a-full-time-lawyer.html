The SKIMS founder recently <a href=#>revealed she’s open to leaving reality T.V.</a> for a full-time career as a lawyer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I would be just as happy being an attorney full time," she revealed while speaking at the TIME100 Summit on Tuesday.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ben Affleck & Matt Damon Were Broke Together After ‘Good Will Hunting’</a></span></p><p>"The journey just really opened up my eyes so much," Kim continued "It gets overwhelming because there's so much to be done ... I brought my sister Khloé [Kardashian] to a prison for the first time last week, and that was really eye-opening for her."</p><p>Kim went on to share her hope that being a lawyer would be her “life’s most meaningful work.”</p><p>"I hope so," she added. "I always joke with my mom — who's my manager — I say Kim K. is retiring, and I'm just going to be an attorney."</p><p>Kim first began her activism for prison reform in October 2017, when she began bringing attention to the case of Alice Marie Johnson, who was convicted for coordinating communications in a drug trafficking case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to the attention Kim helped bring to the case, Alice was released from prison in 2020.</p><p>Kim revealed her plans to complete law school in 2019, which would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her father, Rob Kardashian, who famously represented OJ Simpson.</p><p>The reality star passed the first-year law students examination (often referred to as the “baby bar”) in December 2021, and she’s continuing on with her studies to this day.</p><p>“First year of law school, you have to cover three subjects: criminal law, torts, and contracts,” <a href=#>Kim previously told Vogue</a> of her law school experience. “To me, torts is the most confusing, contracts the most boring, and crim law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The reading is what really gets me,” she went on. “It’s so time-consuming. The concepts I grasp in two seconds.”</p><p>Kim may have a while to go before she’s a full-fledged lawyer, but by her own admission, her days on reality television may be numbered once she gets her license.</p><p>That means Kim is also ready to give up a pretty hefty paycheck. While she likely makes the majority of her income from her businesses, like Skims, <a href=#>Kim was reportedly making $4.5 million per season</a> of Keeping Up with the Kardashians before it ended in 2021. It’s likely she’s making even more for her family’s new Hulu show The Kardashians. But with a billion-dollar net worth, money likely isn’t the first concern on Kim’s mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Morgan Wallen Sued By Fan After Cancelling Concert Due To Sickness</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Parade</a>, <a href=#>Vogue</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWaqmrGjYsCpscNmnqKulWLCsXnRnpiloaSuerV51WarqGWSmnqiecWuo6VlpJ66pnnLmq6ynaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sidney-rice-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sidney Rice Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khing-bassey-biography-wiki-age-parents-state-of-origin-movies-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khing Bassey Biography: Wiki, Age, Parents, State of Origin, Movies, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
