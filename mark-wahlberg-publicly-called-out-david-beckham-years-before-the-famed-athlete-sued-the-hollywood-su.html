As a result, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when David and Victoria Beckham began living near him</a>, <strong>Wahlberg complained about how they ruined the neighborhood</strong> during a 2009 Daily Mail interview.</p><p>"Man, the Beckhams. It used to be so quiet on my road. Then David moves in with his family. Suddenly we’ve got paparazzi hanging out day and night. Now they’ll follow any car that drives down the road.

It is important to note that Wahlberg got in a lot of legal trouble when he was young thanks to his involvement in several violent incidents.</p><p>"Where I come from it's not considered wise to follow people around like that unless you're looking for serious trouble.

However, the quotes don't seem to communicate how angry Wahlberg reportedly was.</p><p>According to Hello Magazine, David and Victoria Beckham sold their Beverly Hills home in 2018.

As a result, <strong>Beckham sued Wahlberg's company for $10 million</strong> he says he was owed in value.
