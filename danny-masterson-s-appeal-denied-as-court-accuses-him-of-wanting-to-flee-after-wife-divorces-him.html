Mr. Masterson was always present for Ms. Phillips during her most difficult times of her life. Ms. Phillips acknowledges that Mr. Masterson is a wonderful father to their daughter.”</p><p>The following month, Bijou made a request for full custody of the 9-year-old daughter she shares with Masterson.

I always felt that she would be OK because Danny is an amazing father,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote in a letter to the court requesting leniency</a>. “He was devoted to our daughter, would read her books, take her on walks and to ballet lessons. I never once heard him complain. The two were inseparable.”</p><p>Other celebs like <a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> and <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> wrote similar letters supporting Masterson before the convicted, though they received public backlash when the news came to light.</p><p>Danny and Bijou have been married since 2011. They welcomed their daughter, Fianna Francis Masterson, in 2014. However, in 2017, multiple women accused Masterson of rape, allegations that he vehemently denied. The accusations led to his firing from the Netflix series The Ranch, subsequent legal proceedings, and now his current incarceration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaernqurdKtnKurn6PAbq3PqZyapF2Zsq%2B1xJ1knKelp8FurcKcrKydo2LEorrToqWgZZahsqZ51qKdnmWUnsOwvsKeZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-how-much-gwyneth-paltrow-s-net-worth-is.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's How Much Gwyneth Paltrow's Net Worth Is</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-football-player-derrick-henry-his-wife-age-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Football Player Derrick Henry?
