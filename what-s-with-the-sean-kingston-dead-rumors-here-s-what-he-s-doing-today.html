Well-known celebrities such as <a href=#>Kanye West,</a> Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, and Nick Jonas have all had death rumors created about them over the years, that soon created a storm then fizzled out as soon as people realized that it was fake news.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Shaken Up After Experiencing The Biz Markie Death Hoax</a></span></p><p>However, Kingston’s rumors about his death stand out from most celebrity death hoaxes due to the fact that it is still widely believed by a lot of people to this day. The rumor about the musician being dead has been so widespread in the past, that many people have believed it and taken the news as fact. But where have these rumors come from? And <a href=#>where is Sean Kingston today?</a> These are the questions that need answering!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on September 6, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Back in 2011, Sean Kingston became the subject of death rumors following a jet ski accident. The 'Beautiful Girls' singer was in dire condition, leaving many to assume he had passed. Well, the rumors carried on despite Sean being alive and well! Many attribute the hoax to simply being a Mandela effect, which has affected countless celebs in the business. Considering Sean stepped away from the limelight for so long, it was only understandable that the public actually believed he was dead. In 2017, Sean officially came back to making music and has released an array of tracks. In 2019, he collaborated with Tory Lanez, and most recently, released his latest single, 'Love Is Wonderful' with Travis Barker back in August 2021. That same month, Sean <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">graced the cover of The Knockturnal</a> magazine, which goes on to discuss his reinvention and return to the music scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=behind-the-quot-sean-kingston-is-dead-quot-rumors>Behind The "Sean Kingston Is Dead" Rumors</h2><p>When talking about the notorious rumor, it is important to first go over the history behind its origin and why it became so widespread and believed in the first place.</p><p>It all started when fake screenshots of BBC News showed a broadcast saying that Sean Kingston died in a jet ski accident in 2011. These screenshots were used in a video that has now been deleted but picked up a lot of traction on the internet across various forums.</p><p>Sean Kingston did, in fact, have a near-fatal jet ski accident in 2011 which landed him in the hospital and resulted in a near life or death situation. He was rushed to the hospital on 29th May 2011 after he was going 35 miles (56.33 km) an hour on a jet ski and miscalculated how high the tide had risen and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ended up colliding with a bridge.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The awful accident turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Kingston who claimed it gave him a new lease on life: “What the accident basically taught me is, in life, you have to count your blessings, you just got to keep God present at all times and think about the consequences.”</p><p>Kingston ended up making a speedy recovery after the accident and stayed out of the limelight for a while in the years that followed but the rumor that he died from this jet ski accident has followed him to this day, which shows just how powerful some viral internet rumors can be.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Rapper Coolio Since Releasing 'Gangsters Paradise'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-the-rumors-simply-a-mandela-effect>Are The Rumors Simply A Mandela Effect?</h2><p>Some people have made the astute point that the rumor surrounding Kingston is another example of the Mandela Effect.</p><p>The Mandela Effect is a false memory phenomenon that emerged in 2010 when paranormal consultant Fiona Broome referenced her false memory of the South African leader Nelson Mandela in the 1980s which was then shared by thousands and sparked numerous other examples of false memories to this day.</p><p>Many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">users on Reddit have spoken out</a> about the connection to the Kingston death hoax rumors, claiming they recall him having passed away. Strange right? It seems like a lot of people have fallen for this rumor over the years and has created a snowball effect of people assuming it is true, which is a common characteristic of stories connected to the Mandela Effect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Controversies Saweeties Has Already Been Involved In</a></span></p><h2 id=what-sean-kingston-is-up-to-today>What Sean Kingston Is Up To Today</h2><p>Despite being one of the biggest names throughout the 2000s, and having an array of hits, Sean Kingston's finances were put into question back in 2017. Considering his absence from the spotlight, plus the rumors regarding his alleged passing, which have obviously been debunked, Sean was asked by TMZ whether he was broke or not, making it clear that his finances, or lack thereof, were simply rumors, too! The singer as of today is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth $2 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After having a long break from the spotlight Kingston decided to come back to the limelight and released his latest song 'Peace of Mind' ft. Tory Lanez in 2019. When it comes to his reasons for staying out of the limelight for so long, Kingston stated that: “I feel the time is right, you know. It’s been a couple of years where I just really had to figure myself out.”</p><p>He then went on to say, “I had to get into a real mental space to make great music again." This seems like the natural course for a musician to take, and he joins the ranks of Avril Lavigne and Ed Sheeran who have taken big breaks during their careers to reinvent themselves and give themselves time to figure themselves out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to what he is doing this year, Kingston has promised that new material is in the works and is working on a new album, but like other musicians during this troubling time has been delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus situation.</p><p>When it comes to his most recent music releases, Sean Kingston <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">partnered up with Travis Barker</a> on their hit song, 'Love Is Wonderful', which they premiered last month. The two also went on to film a music video, which was released the same night as the track did, making it clear that when it comes to music, Sean Kingston isn't going anywhere!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Details About Rapper Silento And Those Murder Charges</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkqHq4tdOhZK2glWLApq3NZqKippeowbC6jJ2cmpxdp8Kuu9GsZKGdoprAbsPHmqtmoJWoeqW7yKeeZqyfma66ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yellowstone-prequel-series-1923-everything-to-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Yellowstone' Prequel Series '1923': Everything to Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./walking-dead-has-ended-but-here-s-what-norman-reedus-has-planned-next.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Walking Dead Has Ended, But Heres What Norman Reedus Has Planned Next</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
