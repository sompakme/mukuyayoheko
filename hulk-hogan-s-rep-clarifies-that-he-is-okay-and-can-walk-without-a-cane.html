Following the appearance, Kurt Angle claimed on his podcast <a href=#>The Kurt Angle Show</a> that Hogan had another back surgery and couldn’t feel his legs following the operation.</p><p>Angle said, “Hogan had his back surgery again. He had the nerves cut from his lower body. He can’t feel his lower body. He uses his cane to walk around. I thought he was using the cane because he had pain in his back. He doesn’t have any pain. He has nothing at all. He can’t feel anything. So now he can’t feel his legs. So he has to walk with a cane which is, you know, that’s pretty serious, man.”</p><p>In an update, those comments appear to be exaggerated. A representative for the Hulkster recently told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> that Hogan is okay. “(Hulk is) doing well and is not paralyzed. Everything is OK with him. Hulk is someone with a lot of humor,” the rep said before confirming the 69-year-old can walk without a cane.</p><p>H/T to <a href=#>Fightful</a> for the transcription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJtaW5paGK1trjKZp%2Bon5GjwG6%2BxKlknKSRp7antcSsZK2gkal6qbGMoqpmp5uWxm6tzZ1knJmeYsSiuMpmrqKsmKTCtXnAZpqappU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacksonville-jaguars-trevor-lawrence-talks-marissa-mowry-marriage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacksonville Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence Talks Marissa Mowry Marriage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emerson-min-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emerson Min Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
