The stunning red carpet appearance <a href=#>was the famous inspiration behind the creation of Google Images.</a></p><p>The singer — <a href=#>who rewore the gown to close out Versace’s fashion show in 2020</a> — later recalled how she felt wearing the dress each time.</p><p>“The first time I wore it, I actually didn’t have another dress. Usually I have choices. It was a last-minute thing that caused a sensation that was unexpected,” she told Vanity Fair in September 2020. “The second time was very planned-out.”</p><p>Lopez continued: “<strong>Donatella [Versace]</strong> said, ‘You know, this year is the 20th anniversary of the jungle dress. I think I’m going to do a whole show about it. Would you come?’ And I said, ‘Of course. Just call me.’ It’s all timing, schedules and stuff. And then she wound up calling and said, ‘I want you to walk at the end, and I want you to come out in the dress.’ The same dress. We’ll make a new one for you.'”</p><p>The Hustlers star <a href=#>recalled the emotions that came with wearing the ensemble</a> again, saying, “The second time I wore it and walked out there, it was such an empowering thing. Twenty years had gone by, and I think for women, knowing you can put on a dress 20 years later — it resonated. It was like, ‘Yes, you know, life is not over at 20!'”</p><p>While filming her Netflix Halftime documentary, Lopez said <a href=#>she struggled with the comments made about her body due to the iconic outfit.</a></p><p>“When I started working, the beauty ideal was very thin: blond, tall, and not a lot of curves. I grew up around women with curves. So it was nothing ever I was ashamed of,” she detailed in the 2022 documentary. “It was hard when you think people think you’re a joke, like you’re a punch line.”</p><p>At the time, the New York native admitted <a href=#>she thought about quitting because of negative comments about her.</a></p><p>“No matter what I achieved, their appetite to cover my personal life overshadowed everything that was happening in my career,” she continued. “I just had very low self-esteem. I really believed a lot of what they said, which is, I wasn’t any good, that I wasn’t a good singer, I wasn’t a good actress, I wasn’t a good dancer. I wasn’t good at anything. I just didn’t belong here. I felt like I was in this really abusive, dysfunctional relationship.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later in the film, footage showed Lopez receiving a hug from Vogue editor <strong>Anna Wintour</strong> <a href=#>when she put on her Versace gown for a second time.</a></p><p>Scroll down to see the most scandalous, revealing and daring dresses worn to the Grammys:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMqKqtZaOYrq%2BwwKWmrqtdnL%2BiucyyZJ2qlajApr%2BMqJ1mmZyherW1zJ5ka2hhZX95fY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pete-davidson-fans-slam-person-who-took-pics-of-him-at-9-11-memorial.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pete Davidson Fans Slam Person Who Took Pics Of Him At 9/11 Memorial</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./man-convicted-of-murder-after-3-teenagers-were-shot-to-death-by-his-then-14-year-old-son-wsoc-tv.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Man convicted of murder after 3 teenagers were shot to death by his then-14-year-old son WSOC TV</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
