Many of them had their breakout TV roles on the series, while some were already big names on the theater circuit. And others, still, have gone on to do big things, including appearing in Oscar-winning films.</p><p>Here’s the net worth of the 10 main cast members, with most data coming from CelebrityNetWorth.com.</p><h2 id=lena-dunham---12-million><strong>Lena Dunham - $12 million</strong></h2><p>Dunham not only starred in the HBO series as the lead character Hannah, but she&nbsp;also served as the writer, director, producer, and creator. Naturally, this earned her big coin through the series’ six-season run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has written other projects as well, including the semi-autobiographical independent film Tiny Furniture, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award.

She most recently had a role in American Horror Story: Cult.</p><h2 id=allison-williams---2-million><strong>Allison Williams - $2 million</strong></h2><p>The daughter of famous former NBC news anchor Brian Williams, this 31-year-old had her breakout role in this series, where she played Marnie, <a href=#>the best friend of Dunham’s character</a>.</p><p>Also a singer, she wrote a series of Funny or Die sketches and appeared as a recurring character in the CollegeHumor series Jake and Amir.</p><p>Her most notable projects since Girls ended have been as Peter Pan in Peter Pan Live!, which aired on NBC in 2014, starring in the Oscar-winning film Get Out in 2017, and appearing in the Netflix horror film The Perfection.</p><h2 id=jemima-kirke---3-million><strong>Jemima Kirke - $3 million</strong></h2><p>This English-American artist and actress, who played Jessa on the show, also starred in Dunham’s independent film Tiny Furniture. This, however, was done as a favor to Dunham, her childhood friend, and thus it didn’t contribute to her overall earnings. She also starred in the indie short film Smile for the Camera, and has appeared in several music videos, including Zayn’s “Dusk Till Dawn.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kirke paints and held her own art show in 2017-2018 featuring portrait-style paintings.
