Now think of the pieces you find the most comfortable and easy to wear. Did you imagine the same piece for both prompts? Probably not. Wearing a fabulous piece often means dealing with suffocating shapewear and strapless bras, while cozy pieces just let you be you. So is there any world where <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the two can come together</a>?</p><p>Yes, and you’re living in it. It’s not necessarily easy to find these pieces, but if you know the right places to look (cough, Shop With Us!), then you’ll get by just fine. Or, if <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this dress</a> is involved, better than “fine.” This flattering piece might just be your favorite cozy-chic find of the year!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yidarton Casual Short Sleeve Maxi Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, September 1, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This cotton-blend dress</a> is so comfy and stretchy, the top almost looks like a cute T-shirt with cuffed cap sleeves and a relaxed fit. Unlike a T-shirt, however, you don’t need to tuck it into your bottoms or even let it hang loose. The fabric instead gathers at the natural waist, where you’ll also notice a removable tie belt. Tie it into a bow, take it off completely or swap it with a totally different type of belt!</p><p>The fabric of the skirt drapes gorgeously so that it will never cling to your legs, reaching all the way down to the ankles — at least most of the way around. You have a surplice hem here, creating a slit that travels up and above the knee in the front, further flattering your shape while adding an extra bit of charm to this already eye-catching piece!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yidarton Casual Short Sleeve Maxi Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10</a> at Amazon!

You have so many solids, from Black, to Tangerine, to Sky Blue, to Army Green and beyond, but you also have leopard prints, snakeskin and florals if you’re looking for a little something extra!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This dress</a> is already versatile in its construction, but it’s versatile when it comes to wearing it out too. Go casual with a cropped denim jacket and <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> or a beanie, peacoat and booties, or dress it up with heeled <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> and a gem-embellished headband and metallic belt. Once you own it, the inspiration will flow non-stop!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yidarton Casual Short Sleeve Maxi Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10</a> at Amazon!
