Boss took his own life. He was 40.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alison Holker Statement</h2><p>Holker, 34 years old, expressed her sadness by saying, “It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share that my husband Stephen has left us.” “Stephen brought a ray of sunshine into every room he entered.</p><p>Above all else, he placed the utmost importance on his family, his friends, and the community he lived in. Leading with love and light was everything to him. He was <a href=#>the rock</a> upon which it built our household, the epitome of a devoted husband, father, and a model for all his admirers.</p><p>Boss and Holker became fast friends via their shared passion for dance while competing on “So You Think You Can Dance.”</p><p>They celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary on Saturday, and Boss, who specialized in hip-hop, and Holker, who specialized in contemporary jazz, spread delight by routinely sharing videos of themselves dancing together on social media, including one only a couple of days ago.</p><p>In her statement, Holker continued by saying, “To say that he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alison Holker pays tribute to Twitch</h2><p>I firmly believe that we will never let a single day pass without paying tribute to his memory. During this challenging time for our family, especially for our three children, we ask that you respect our need for privacy.</p><p>Stephen, we want you to know that we love and miss you very much. I promise that I will always keep the last dance for you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Friends and dance colleague’s Reaction</h2><p>Boss was also lovingly recalled by Ellen DeGeneres, who shared a photo of herself hugging her colleague on the set of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” Boss passed away earlier this year.</p><p>DeGeneres posted the picture on social media, saying, “I’m heartbroken.” “tWitch was nothing but unadulterated love and light. Because he was a family member, I loved him with all my being. I am going to miss him. Please show Allison and his three stunning children, Weslie, Maddox, and Zaia, all of the love and support you can muster.</p><p>Mary Murphy and Nigel Lythgoe, the original judges on “So You Think You Can Dance,” praised Jennifer Boss’s perseverance and dedication in their statements to People magazine and The Times, respectively. Murphy said that Boss had tried out for the competition program numerous times but was unsuccessful, yet, “he persevered and returned again.”</p><p>“My spirit is grieving, and the pain penetrates the very cells of my body.</p><p>I felt like a doting mother when it came to TwitchTwitch. “He was hungry, ready, and willing to do the work that would lift him in spirit and means,” stated Murphy. “He was willing to perform the work that would lift him in spirit and means.”</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCty6KqqKZdnbytt8SrZKyskamyrrHNrWSopl2dsrN5x66qm5memXqlscCtn2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chl%C3%B6e-opens-up-about-being-cheated-on-multiple-times.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chle Opens Up About Being Cheated On Multiple Times</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-most-exclusive-and-expensive-seiko-watches.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Most Exclusive And Expensive Seiko Watches</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
