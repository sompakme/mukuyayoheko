The 22-year old entrepreneur created a brand that has established a lasting legacy. Seiko started making wall clocks and pocket watches during the late 1890s and made history by creating the first wristwatch in Japan. The first luxury watch introduced under the moniker was the Grand Seiko in 1960. <a href=#>Known to build affordable and durable timepieces</a>, their watches have earned the company millions of dollars in sales. The regular collection offers long-lasting features, and <a href=#>the exclusive collection</a> is an extension of the features with a touch of heritage and elegance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seiko has been a long-established brand from vintage models to new, sleek, and elegantly built watches for generations. Showcasing watches that stand the test of time, let’s take a look at the most exclusive and expensive watches by Seiko.</p><h2 id=grand-seiko-heritage-collection-sbga211>Grand Seiko Heritage Collection SBGA211</h2><p>First launched in 2016, the SBGA211 is one of the most coveted models, costing upwards of $5800, as noted by <a href=#>Rarest</a>. With a titanium case and a Snowflake dial, the Heritage Collection watch has a power reserve of 72 hours displayed on the case. The spring drive moment offers accuracy, and the watch is water-resistant up to 100 meters in the water.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrist Game Strong: 8 Fantastic Watches In Justin Bieber's Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=grand-seiko-slga001>Grand Seiko SLGA001</h2><p>A watch to mark a special occasion, the SLGA001 was introduced to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Grand Seiko in 2010. This limited edition watch is a rare collectible and has a price tag of $11,100. The titanium silver case makes it lighter than steel and scratch-resistant. The <a href=#>sapphire crystal glass</a> is water-resistant up to 600 meters, and the movement is accurate within 0.5 seconds.</p><h2 id=grand-seiko-elegance-sbgw260>Grand Seiko Elegance SBGW260</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Seiko Elegance collection has always been expensive due to the customization options based on the material constructions. These watches can be made from titanium, platinum, stainless steel, and gold. While the base model costs $4,300, the SBGW260 is from the more expensive spectrum costing $29,000. It is made with stainless steel and a hand-wound mechanical dial. It has a 72-hour power reserve and offers a luxurious look with its brown leather strap.</p><h2 id=seiko-astronomical-observatory-chronometer>Seiko Astronomical Observatory Chronometer</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rarest of the rare, Seiko only made 73 Astronomical Observatory Chronometer watches in 1968, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watches By Six</a>. The case, dials, and handles are made from 18-carat gold which increased the expenses, and the brand decided to discontinue the watch. A few years ago, one of the 73 watches was sold for $40,000; however, it didn’t come with the box or original strap. If one of the <a href=#>watches in the collection</a> resurfaced, it would become the most expensive Seiko watch.</p><h2 id=grand-seiko-heritage-collection-sbga385>Grand Seiko Heritage Collection SBGA385</h2><p>The SBGA385 is from a bunch of 20 limited series watches made under the Heritage Collection. Made with spring drive construction, the watch has 30 jewels embedded inside. The platinum case has sapphire crystal glass and an anti-reflective coating to prevent any glares. This watch series was exclusively designed and manufactured to be sold in the United States for $53,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=grand-seiko-elegance-collection-sbgw263>Grand Seiko Elegance Collection SBGW263</h2><p>Easily one of the most valuable watches in the collection, the SBSW263 is from the Elegance Collection and stands true to its name. The case is made in platinum with 18-carat gold on the back with dual-covered sapphire crystal glass. <a href=#>Made with 24 jewels</a>, it has an engraved lion in the back. The watch has been a part of a limited series edition with only 20 units produced, which increases its cost to a whopping $97,000.</p><h2 id=grand-seiko-masterpiece-collection-sbgd207>Grand Seiko Masterpiece Collection SBGD207</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rarest of the Seiko watches belong to the Masterpiece Collection, and the SBGD207 is no different. Only 15 units of the watch have been manufactured, making it the rarest timepiece from Seiko. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Seiko</a>, the watch features 97 diamonds, 56 jewels, and 24 green garnets. The polished sapphire crystal case and immaculate platinum stand true to its Masterpiece name. It comes with a price tag of $185,000.</p><h2 id=grand-seiko-sbgd205-spring-drive>Grand Seiko SBGD205 Spring Drive</h2><p>To top the list, the SBGD205 comes with a spring drive dial and an 8-day power reserve, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drive Tribe</a>. The platinum case was inspired by the early winter mornings in Central Japan. The dial is embedded with baguette diamonds and beautiful blue sapphires and set over an 18-carat white gold base. The watch also comes with a price tag of $185,000, similar to the SBGD207 in the Masterpiece Collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Creating durable watches that offer water-resistance and anti-reflective surfaces, Seiko has ensured that users get the ultimate experience of strapping a rare Seiko watch to their wrists. From using precious jewels and embedding the <a href=#>rarest of diamonds</a>, Seiko has established itself as a brand that can make great watches for everyday use and special occasions if needed.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>From Oscars To Golden Globes: The Most Expensive Red Carpet Jewelry Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=#> Rarest</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Watches By Six</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Grand Seiko</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Drive Tribe</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSFbrnOrKtmnaiYuba%2FyK%2BcZpmemXqmxM%2Bepayhppp6tLHIpKZmr5GpsKmx0mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alison-holker-statement-on-her-husband-s-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alison Holker Statement On Her Husbands Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./willis-mcgahee-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Willis McGahee Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
