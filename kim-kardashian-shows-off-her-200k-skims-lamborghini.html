It's official. Kim Kardashian is the proud new owner of a completely customized $200,000 Lamborghini that she can't even drive anywhere. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Input Magazine</a> reports that the car is made completely of Skims Cozy material in all-white, and it's absolutely just a $200,000 non-functional trophy that's likely to be used for nothing more than bragging rights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Of Kim Kardashian's Most Expensive Purses</a></span></p><p>Most people can only ever dream of owning a Lamborghini. The majority of people out there can't even imagine being able to say they have a completely customized Lamborghini to call their own, let alone one that is purchased for viewing and can't even be driven.</p><p>However, this is Kim Kardashian's reality. Most fans are aware that she is the founder of her very own, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highly successful brand</a> of flattening and flattering undergarments called SKIMS, and as a gift to Kim, SKIMS went ahead and completely customized a $200,000 Lamborghini in all white Skims Cozy fabric.</p><p>The white, furry fabric covers the car in its entirety, both inside and out. The material is designed for wear and is certainly not created for automotive use, thus rendering this stunning, powerful, luxury vehicle absolutely useless. The white fabric would be instantly destroyed the moment this car goes into motion, and considering the fact that even the rims are covered in white SKIMs furry-fabric, it is definitely not a practical choice for getting around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the interior of the car is exactly the same and bears some embossed SKIMS branding as well.</p><p>When it comes to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">living in the lap of luxury</a>, this is definitely a story to tell and a precious piece of bragging rights that is truly worth cherishing.</p><p>While it's unlikely that Kim can actually make use of this car in any way, it's become a real head-turner on social media, prompting the likes of her longtime pal and socialite Paris Hilton to issue a response.</p><p>Paris commented on Kim's Instagram post by saying, "You know you're rich rich when you can ruin a very expensive car for something like this," followed by a series of emojis to reiterate her statement.</p><p>Kim may not be able to actually use this fabulously decorated car, but she has a matching SKIMS outfit to perfectly match it and has posing next to it with pride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian's SKKN Brand Hit With Cease & Desist Letters Over Name</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Input Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrLUq6myZaWnwrR5yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlo528uL%2BMqJ2fZZiav25%2Bj2miZqubnrq0ecuapJunopy1qrrIaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-sadie-loza-meet-audrina-patridge-s-late-niece.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Sadie Loza?
