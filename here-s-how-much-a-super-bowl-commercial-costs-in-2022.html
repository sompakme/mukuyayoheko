This year, all the advertisers ran their ads across Telemundo and <a href=#>Peacock, NBS's streaming</a>, for the first time. By the way, 40 percent of the adversaries were entirely new. Additionally, the ads were spread over 12 categories, but the prevailing areas were technology, health & wellness, entertainment, automotive, and travel. Interestingly, <a href=#>crypto companies</a>&nbsp;and electric automakers entered the Super Bowl ad market for the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter writes</a> that Dan Lovinger, the Olympics ad sales for NBCUniversal lead, stated this year the ads are less into the pandemic but more into comedy.

Super Bowl is one of the most-watched American TV broadcasts every year. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As Kantar Sports MONITOR study 2021</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a>, 67% of fans over age 18 stated they were extremely interested in watching the Super Bowl this year. This number outruns <a href=#>the 2022 Winter Olympics</a> and the World Cup!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's how it started. Since the 1980s, Super Bowl commercials have become commonplace. It began with Apple's "1984" ad made by Chiat/Day and Ridley Scott. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today, it's considered a masterpiece, but it was quite a debatable futuristic ad back then.</a> The Macintosh-launching Super Bowl ad cost $1 mln, but the ad paid back by boosting the sales of Macintosh computers to $3.5 mln. By the way, Macintosh is today's Mac - the new name appeared in 1998. So, that's how Super Bowl commercials became attractive to advertisers and popular among viewers. As millions of people watch the game, companies and brands MUST use this opportunity to expose themselves and attract more customers.</p><p>According to Kantar's Sports MONITOR's fan insight service, ads are more popular to watch than the halftime show; they rank third in popularity, resulting in a strong return on investment (ROI) of $4.60 for every dollar spent.</p><h2 id=2022-advertisers>2022 Advertisers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There are over 30 advertisers, 40 percent of which buy airtime</a>. The commercial veterans are Kia, <a href=#>Amazon</a>, BMW, General Motors, Toyota, Google, Uber Eats, Turkish Airlines, Taco Bell, TurboTax, T-Mobile, Jeep, Nissan, Doritos, etc. Among the new advertisers are Sam's Club, Coinbase, FTX, Irish Spring, Booking.com, Carvana, Crypto.com, eToro, BitBuy, Hologic, Rakuten, <a href=#>Meta (yes, no more Facebook)</a>, and more.</p><p>This year many ads are with celebrities: <a href=#>Zendaya</a>, Lindsay Lohan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gwyneth Paltrow, Mila Kunis, Demi Moore, <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>, Jim Carrey, etc. No wonder, according to the last-year survey by The Marketing Arm, 50 percent of the respondents believe celebrities in ads work. "Across every demographic, more than half of all viewers prefer ads with celebrities, with an even greater preference among Black, Hispanic, Gen Z and <a href=#>Millennial</a>&nbsp;viewers,"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> as quotes the Atlantic.</a> "The Marketing Arm," it writes, "is one of the celebrity talent bookers for Super Bowl commercials. It said it polled 1,000 people across different regions of the country, ages, genders, ethnicities and generations in August about their preferences for the game."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a href=#>Drake Wins Nearly $300,000 With Big Super Bowl Bets</a></p><h2 id=super-bowl-lvi-ads>Super Bowl LVI Ads</h2><p>Kantar writes that creativity is key, quoting Alfredo Troncoso, the partner for Brand & Marketing ROI, "Super Bowl ads not only have an immediate impact on a brand's <a href=#>sales </a>and revenue but also have a compelling impact on brand perceptions, fan engagement and help drive brand awareness and equity." Kantar's AI-powered creative evaluation tool found that 'Strong' Super Bowl ads improved ad recall by 40% compared with 'Average' ads; additionally, brand awareness increased by 20%.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Susan Lauinger, Kantar's North America Content Leader, stated that the Super Bowl ads are "the best type of storytelling is that which is in lockstep with culture." This year, the ads reflected American culture, humor, and entertainment. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Virginia marketing professor Kimberly Whitler said to Associated Press</a>, "Marketers are recognizing <a href=#>Americans</a>&nbsp;have had a very heavy, difficult two-year period and are responding by bringing some good old-fashioned entertainment for Super Bowl Sunday."</p><p>Yet, one more aspect was shown in the ads - representation. Kantar writes, "It's still subtle by comparison, but the fact that we are beginning to see these dynamics presented in a more intentional manner during the Super Bowl is good news for brand and consumer relationships. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Global MONITOR</a>, 65% of consumers say that it's important that the companies they buy from actively promote diversity and inclusion in their own business or society as a whole. For brands to resonate deeply with consumers, they need to speak up on matters that matter and authentically represent themselves, their <a href=#>audience</a>, and the times in which we live."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=decline-in-viewership>Decline in Viewership</h2><p>Okay, if Super Bowl is so popular, why is there a declining tendency in viewership? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Last year only 92 mln people tuned in</a>; it's the lowest viewership since 2007. Yet, the Super Bowl is not the only event that faced this issue, Grammy, Oscar, the Olympics have the same, and still, Super Bowl has the best results.</p><p>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tinder Swindler Earned $30,000 In 3 Days From New Hustle</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6diuravx2aYZqulpbKzecGorqVlk6S6rrHRnKCapF2YvLTA0magp2ViZX9zew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicki-minaj-post-malone-to-headline-made-in-america-2018.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicki Minaj, Post Malone To Headline 'Made In America' 2018</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./greg-doucette-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Greg Doucette Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
