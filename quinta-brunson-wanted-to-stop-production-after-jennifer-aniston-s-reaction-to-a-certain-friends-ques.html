"Oh God, don't make me cry," said the former who could barely hold her tears back. The latter responded, "I won't... We won't make each other cry," to which the We're the Millers alum said, "Okay." <strong>But then Aniston started crying, so Brunson offered to take a break</strong>.

Brunson said, "So Friends is turning 30," to which Aniston added, "And I'm turning 30." She then shared a premiere memory including Perry and <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong>.</p><p>"It's so strange to even think that it's 30 years old, 'cause actually, I remember the day that it was going to premiere, you know on television on NBC."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turned out, the day of the premiere, Aniston and Perry played a messy prank on Kudrow during her hair appointment. "Me and Matthew Perry were having lunch somewhere, and we knew Lisa was getting her hair colored," she recalled. "So we ran into the hair salon and I snuck up and she was in the sink the hair bowl and I took the nozzle and just started like washing her hair from the guy that was supposed to be doing it."</p><p><strong>That was how "excited" they were back then</strong>. "And it definitely flew out of control and that. And that was unfortunate, but the excitement we had," Aniston continued. "And it feels like yesterday, that day... So <strong>the fact that</strong><strong>[Friends] has had this long wonderful life and it's still... means a lot to people is one of the greatest gifts I think all five of us, all six of us ever â€“ we never could imagine</strong>." She went on to call her co-stars <strong>"family forever"</strong>.</p><p>The Friends cast was the first group to negotiate an equal individual salary of $100,000 per episode in 1997 (season 4).
