According to Vogue, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ceremony was very intimate</a>, hosting only 60 people and 8 bridesmaids to “witness the couple exchange vows which they wrote themselves.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amongst those 60 people were some pretty famous faces such as bridesmaids, Tommy Dorfman and Taylor Swift. A picture released showed Swift and Dorfman sat happily in their bridesmaid attires at what seemed to be Dunham’s wedding reception.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things Taylor Swift's Friends And Colleagues Have Said About Her</a></span></p><p>Speaking on her choice of bridesmaids, Dunham stated, “You can have a far bigger wedding with less bridesmaids, but I guess it just speaks to how excited I was to have my close friends there.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added, “I spent so much time during the pandemic talking to my girlfriends about our feelings over FaceTime, but a few of my best friends I haven’t seen in over a year, and, you know, my girlfriends have had to deal with a lot of not-so-happy things with me in our adulthood, so to be able to celebrate something joyful and use it as an excuse to be together was very special.”</p><p>However, following the pictures released of Swift as her role of bridesmaid, masses of fans took to Twitter to bash the singer. They pointed out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple controversies </a>that Dunham had been involved in from sexual abuse allegations to “hipster racism” and even cruel treatment of pets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, one trolled Swift and her fanbase as they stated, “So y'all hero #taylorswift decided no-lips, fake #metoo yodeler, let me finger my sister, black ppl are only 4 the tap dance, let me bother blk men/women while they scroll & live unbothered, let me kill yet ANOTHER pet- @lenadunham is the friend she needed in her life. Bet.”</p><p>Another critic mentioned, “of course Taylor Swift is a bridesmaid at Lena Dunham's wedding. messy and disgusting goes together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst another added, ”i’m so sorry but i’m officially done with taylor swift stop making excuses for her she was a bridesmaid in lena dunham’s wedding.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Lena Dunham Got Fired From An HBO Show</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, some Swift fans chose to reach out to the singer to plead her to stop associating herself with Dunham. One stated, “@taylorswift13 blondie we love you but Lena Dunham is just not it you shouldn’t associate yourself with the likes of her.”</p><p>Others just could not comprehend why Swift would want to actively be involved with someone who had acted so “disgustingly.” They questioned Swift's own morality as they believed one's friends are a direct reflection of oneself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think Jake Gyllenhaal Is Scared Of Taylor Swift's 'Red' Re-Recording</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrO2vsiorKxlkal6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjJ%2Bmq2WSmravs4ybqaKclai6orXDZpitZZyau6J5w66loZmdqHq4scOdoKefXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./finola-hughes-plastic-surgery-before-and-after-weight-and-health-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Finola Hughes Plastic Surgery Before And After: Weight And Health Update</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cristina-ali-farah-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cristina Ali Farah Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
