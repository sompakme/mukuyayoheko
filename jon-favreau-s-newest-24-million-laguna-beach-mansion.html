He also serves as a writer and executive producer for its spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett.</p><p>He is perhaps best known today as an actor who’s starred in numerous Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbusters — “Avengers: Endgame,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and the “Iron Man” franchise, just to name a few — but he also directed and produced the recent remakes of “The Lion King” and “The Jungle Book,” and is the creator of “The Mandalorian” Star Wars series on Disney+. The New York City native got his professional start in indie films during the 1990s; notable works included 1996’s “Swingers” and 2001’s “Made.” Per various reports, his net worth exceeds $100 million.</p><p>Another Hollywood biggie to purchase a luxurious home is Jon Favreau. After keeping it rock solid in the industry for 30 years, the film icon has gathered a bounty of riches – part of which he recently spent on a mega mansion at Laguna Beach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>, Turns out the mystery buyer who last summer paid about $24.3 million for a Laguna Beach mansion was Jon Favreau, the prolific Hollywood multi-hyphenate who’s been working steadily in the industry for 30 years. Sited in guard-gated Irvine Cove, which the listing describes as Orange County’s premier oceanfront community, the Mediterranean villa-style home seems an ample reward for those decades of filmmaking.</p><p>As for the Laguna Beach residence, the citadel-like house stands several stories tall and is fully landlocked, backing up to a rugged hill. But the property has dramatic whitewater views, and it also sports direct access to one of the most secluded and desirable beaches in Orange County. Built in the late 1990s, the 8,600-square-foot structure was sold to Favreau by real estate businessman Michael Narlinger and his wife Kimberly.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Roxy Jacenko Mother Doreen Davis’ $7.8 Million Mansion Will Be ‘Yeezy-Inspired’</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hulking villa was also recently renovated, per the listing, and the interior spaces are unabashedly opulent, with stone columns and wood-beamed ceilings everywhere. Highlights include numerous French doors that spill out to view terraces, a kitchen with granite countertops and premium appliances, a movie theater and elevator. Upstairs, the primary suite offers a sitting area and private terrace with unstoppable water and sunset views.</p><p>On the home’s lowest level lies an oversized lounge and wet bar that opens to a pool and poolside cabana. There are two separate grassy lawns, plus an outdoor fireplace.</p><p>Some of the Irvine Cove neighbors include billionaire Sue Gross, “Cheers” creator James Burrows, LA Fitness founder Chin Yol Yi and hedge fund manager Joseph Edelman, whose $70 million estate is right across the street from Favreau’s digs and recently broke the record for most expensive Orange County home ever sold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As reported by <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>, Besides their new Laguna vacation home, Favreau and longtime wife Joya Tillem also maintain a luxury compound consisting of three side-by-side houses in prime Santa Monica. The couple acquired the three properties from three different sellers in three separate transactions: the first in 2002, the second in 2005 and the third just last year, for a total outlay of $6.9 million. Favreau also owns a $5 million property in Venice, which is reportedly used as offices for his Fairview Entertainment production company.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Sam Smith Spotted Wearing A $1,800 Bottega Veneta Handbag While Heading To Global Studio</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Wikipedia</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajp55is6LC0Z6Yrqtdo7K4sdKtZGtsXaK2rbjIqKVmpJGcwq%2BtjJucmpuYYrqiutKipqdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-camille-hyde-boyfriend-connor-jean-on-instagram-explore-more-about-the-cast-of-all-american.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Camille Hyde Boyfriend Connor Jean on Instagram Explore More About The Cast Of All American</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-pronounce-audemars-piguet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to pronounce audemars piguet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
