He is the current head coach of the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League. He has previously served as the head coach of the Washington Capitals and Boston Bruins Bruce Cassidy has ponied up $4.9 million for a home on the outskirts of Sin City, in the far west Las Vegas valley, near his team’s practice facility. Clark County property records show the professional ice hockey player turned coach and his wife Julie closed on the deal earlier this month.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>15 Photos That Prove Alessandra Ambrosio Is Brazil's Greatest Export</b></a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>, Tucked away in the prestigious Ridges development, Cassidy’s new digs are less than five miles from City National Arena, where the Golden Knights practice. Because of that proximity, Summerlin is a popular destination for Golden Knights players and coaches whereas Las Vegas Raiders prefer a location closer to their practice facility in West Henderson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cassidy was hired by the Golden Knights in June, just eight days after getting fired by the Boston Bruins. The sports media reported the Golden Knights signed Cassidy to a five-year contract that pays him $4.5 million a year.</p><p>Built in 2020 and set on just under a third of an acre, the contemporary stone, stucco and glass home was listed by Ken Lowman of Luxury Homes of Las Vegas. Marketing materials describe the two-story home as measuring 5,952 square feet with five bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms and a three-car garage. Other highlights include a gourmet kitchen with a walk-in pantry, an office, a wine cellar, and a wet bar. The main level features a great room, with disappearing doors that lead to the backyard, where there’s a swimming pool and spa, a covered living space, and a built-in barbecue.</p><p>Among the downstairs bedroom is one that could easily serve as the primary suite, while there’s a second primary suite, along with a couple bedrooms and a family room, up on the second floor. Views from the second story sweep over the mountains and the nearby Summit Club resort community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s a beautiful and modern luxury home,” Lowman said. “It has all the latest and greatest style, with four-foot porcelain tile floors and Quartzite countertops. One of its unique features is it has two primary bedrooms, one on the first floor and one on the second floor. It has custom designer-selected light fixtures.”</p><p>Luxury agent Ivan Sher, who was with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices at the time but has since started his own agency, served as Cassidy’s agent.</p><p>Cassidy, who played defenceman for the Chicago Blackhawks back in the 1980s, and his wife have already put their home in Winchester, Mass., on the market for $2.9 million. They bought the 4,800-square-foot, six-bedroom home in 2017 for $2 million and added a backyard hockey rink.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvs8HCnmScmaOotqXFjKyjnp2bYsCquoycoK2xXZ28rrGMnKasrKNigW6FjKagpaSZpLtw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coby-bird-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Coby Bird Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-trey-gowdy-and-curt-gowdy-related.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Trey Gowdy And Curt Gowdy Related?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
