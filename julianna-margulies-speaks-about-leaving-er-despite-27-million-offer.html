And I ran my finger down a shelf and I picked out a book, Awakening the Buddha Within,” she said. “I brought it home and I said nothing. I walked into my bedroom, I opened the book, I closed my eyes, and I [pointed to a line in the book]. And I opened my eyes and the line was, 'I knew I wanted to learn more, not earn more,’” she added.</p><p>Margulies was initially tapped to star in ER as a guest star. But George Clooney called her and discouraged her from taking other acting gigs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress didn’t think that it was possible for her to become a series regular in the medical drama because her character was already killed off. Additionally, she had already filmed two episodes for Homicide: Life on the Street.</p><p>But it all worked out for the actress in the end. She eventually became a regular in ER and was part of the hit TV series for six seasons.</p><p>In fact, ER was such a huge part of the actress’s success in the industry. After all, she earned an Emmy in 1995 for supporting actress in a drama series.</p><p>The TV show also <a href=#>helped the actress reach her whopping $22 million net worth</a>. For every episode of ER that she starred in, Margulies reportedly made thousands.</p><p>She also made $180,000 per episode when she starred in The Good Wife. Unfortunately, the series was canceled after seven seasons in 2016.</p><p>However, the actress still has other sources of income. She will soon release her memoir, Sunshine Girl: An Unexpected Life. She will also <a href=#>star in the second season of The Morning Show </a>alongside Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>12 Celebs Who Turned Down Iconic Movie & TV Roles</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=#>People</a>, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3trjImqWnmV2irrOz1KWgnqtdobKiwsRmnKtlnZ65rbXOp2Sonpaav3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-wayne-had-eight-root-canals-on-tuesday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Wayne Had Eight Root Canals on Tuesday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-joann-fabrics-rose-from-the-ashes-of-the-pandemic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Joann Fabrics Rose from the Ashes of the Pandemic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
