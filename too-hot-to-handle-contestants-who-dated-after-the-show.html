They have also found fame after the show, with <a href=#>massive success and mouth-watering net worths,</a> a decent following on social media, and a whole new life in the public sphere. So here's a look at the Too Hot to Handle alums who dated during the show, and continued their romance outside the villa, as well as some who got together after the show wrapped.</p><h2 id=rhonda-paul-and-sharron-townsend><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rhonda Paul And Sharron Townsend</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sharron-and-rhonda.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hot mom and model connected with Sharron on deep emotional levels, with the pair already discussing plans outside the villa.
