When he got the call, he cleaned out his locker and never looked back. He was main-eventing PPVs while other NXT Superstars were being called up. They were hungry, but after a while, things changed. The current NXT locker room does nothing but play around on their phones and act entitled. Corbin built this place. He came through the doors tonight, and the superstars in the back can’t even look him in the eyes.</p><p>Corbin is going to make everyone here regret ever signing a WWE contract. Every single one of them is soft and weak. The NXT Champion Carmelo Hayes walks around like his stuff doesn’t stink. Hayes got a dose of main roster reality last week when Corbin took him out. Ilja Dragonuv interrupts. Dragonuv introduces himself to Corbin. Corbin says he knows who he is and wants to know what he wants. Dragonuv came out to look Corbin in the eye and tell him he isn’t soft or weak. He’s the first person in line to face Carmelo Hayes for the NXT Championship. Corbin says this is that “NXT entitlement.”</p><h4 id=h-check-out-last-week-s-coverage-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-23-gigi-dolin-vs-jacy-jayne-mystery-attacker-revealed>Check Out Last Week’s Coverage: <a href=#>WWE NXT Results (5/30/23): Gigi Dolin vs. Jacy Jayne, Mystery Attacker Revealed</a></h4><p>He’s wrestled at WrestleMania six times. Dragonuv doesn’t care. Corbin says he jumped the line because he could. Dragonuv challenges Corbin to a match tonight. Corbin asks if Dragonuv really wants a match after what happened to him at Battleground. Dragonuv lifts up his shirt and reveals a nasty bruise. Dragonuv says there is nothing Corbin can do to him. Corbin retorts that it’s a cute little bruise, but when he is done with Dragonuv, his body will be covered in them. Dragonuv leaves the ring. Trick Williams attacks Corbin from behind. Williams clotheslines Corbin over the top rope.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h4>The Creed Brother and Ivy Nile vs. The Dyad and Ava Rayne</h4><p>Fowler drives Julius into the corner. Reid tags in and gets slammed by Julius. Julius and Brutus work over Reid. Julius picks up Reid and deadlifts him into a delayed verticle suplex. While holding Reid, Julius tags Brutus in and hands Reid to him. Brutus walks around the ring kicking his feet as he has Reid in the suplex position. Brutus walks back over to his corner, tags in Julius, and hands Reid back. Julius squats while holding Reid in the air and finally hits the suplex.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rayne tags in and slaps Julius. Nile rushes the ring and has a standoff with Rayne. Rayne and Nile jaw at each other. Rayne tags in Fowler. Brutus gets a blind tag and catches Fowler with an axehandle off the top. Brutus press slams Fowler and sticks a standing moonsault (that was impressive). Julius tags in, and Brutus slingshots him onto Fowler. Nile suplexes Brutus onto Fowler. Julius tosses Nile in the air, and she lands on Fowler. After the break, The Dyad is working over Brutus. Brutus manages to tag in Julius.</p><p>Julius lands a series belly to belly suplexes on Reid and Fowler. Julius suplexes Reid and Fowler at the same time. Everyone lands a big move. The only people left standing are Nile and Rayne. Nile lands a flurry of strikes. Rayne nails Nile with a spin kick. Rayne tries a suplex, but Nile reverses it into the Dragon Slayer. Reid breaks it up and gets put to sleep by Nile’s Dragon Slayer. The referee tries to get Reid out of the ring. Rayne puts on her mask and headbutts Nile. Rayne pins Nile.</p><p>Winners- The Dyad and Ava Rayne</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h4>WWE NXT Results Continue on the Next Page!</h4><p class=post-nav-links>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJwb2tsYmLEuLGMp6%2BtZaKawLa406xkb2VmYn90</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chrishell-stause-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chrishell Stause - photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-chesky-gay-hoax-debunked-a-look-at-his-wife-and-married-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Morgan Chesky Gay Hoax Debunked: A Look At His Wife and Married Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
