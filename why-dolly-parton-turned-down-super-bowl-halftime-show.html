When you think about those shows, those are big, big productions. I’ve never done anything with that big of a production. I don’t know if I could have. I think at the time that’s what I was thinking.”</p><p>While it is absolutely wild to know that Parton thinks there’s anything she couldn’t do or isn’t “big enough” to play the Super Bowl, it’s also nice to know that even icons struggle with self-confidence sometimes.</p><p>Parton, however, is nothing if not humble despite her mind-blowing career success. When she was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year, she initially turned down the honor because she didn’t feel she deserved it.</p><p>“Even though I am extremely flattered and grateful to be nominated … I don’t feel that I have earned that right,” she wrote in a statement shared via social media in March 2022. “I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Parton later changed her mind and was officially inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2022. “This is a very special night for me,” she said in her speech. “I’m sure a lot of you knew that back when they said they were gonna put me in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I didn’t really feel like I had done enough to deserve that. And I didn’t understand at the time that it’s about more than that. But I’m just honored and so proud to be here tonight.”</p><p>She also noted that the honor had inspired her to make <a href=#>her own rock album</a> so that one day she might be worthy of her position in the Hall of Fame. Parton has since made good on that promise, <a href=#>with the rock-inspired Rockstar</a> dropping Friday, November 17. The <a href=#>star-studded record</a> features collaborations with music legends including <a href=#><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ringo Starr</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Stevie Nicks</strong></a>, <strong>Debbie Harry</strong> and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2ZvK242GanmqqkpLtuwNSrpZ6cXZm8uLqMrKypnaJir7DDy2afmqSWqbausYysn6ivXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-nobody-expected-ren%C3%A9e-zellweger-to-be-cast-in-bridget-jones-s-diary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Nobody Expected Rene Zellweger To Be Cast In Bridget Jones's Diary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-are-the-top-former-contestants-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Are The Top Former Contestants Today?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
