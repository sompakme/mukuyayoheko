Fans of movies are accustomed to seeing one or two big stars in a film and maybe a celebrity cameo. The reasoning behind the choice to keep stars in small numbers primarily has to do with money. The more popular a celebrity, the more they charge for screen time.

The director of the film said while shooting, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How about Christian and J.D. [John David Washington] just shut up for this one and let Taylor do it</a>?” Bale knew letting Swift take over was the right decision, saying “we had been drowning out an angel’s voice all day long with our cacophony and our rough, terrible voices.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-as-liz-meekins><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift As Liz Meekins</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift is the celebrity cameo everyone was excited about in Amsterdam.
