However, being such a big star in the public eye doesn't come without judgment, with many stars being heavily judged on their appearance. Despite this, it seems as though Kourtney has been feeling very positive about her own perception of herself.</p><h2 id=kourtney-has-struggled-in-the-past-with-comments-about-her-body>Kourtney Has Struggled In The Past With Comments About Her Body</h2><p>Anyone who's watched the Kardashians on reality TV likely knows that Kourtney is a huge fan of vegan and organic food, and <a href=#>even encourages her children to eat the same healthy diet that she follows</a>.</p><p>She has also <a href=#>previously expressed her interest in the keto diet in 2018</a>, even trying it out herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, despite always looking what most would consider 'picture perfect', the star has shared that she has still struggled at times with comments from others about her appearance.</p><p>One example of this is in 2020, when a fan commented on one of her posts, where she was pictured lounging in a bikini, stating that the star was pregnant.</p><p>Kourtney quickly responded to the false claim, stating: “This is me when I have a few extra pounds on, and I actually love it.
