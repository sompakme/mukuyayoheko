The signing was huge at the time as the biggest star in wrestling left WWE for the first time for a new start in WCW. Hogan reinvented his career by turning heel to join Kevin Nash and Scott Hall forming <a href=#>the New World Order</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wrestlers had mixed reactions to working with Hogan due to his actions behind the scenes. Stories and rumors have continued to come out throughout the years after WCW ended with the rise in podcasts, books, shoot interviews and WWE specials. Hogan likely wants to avoid discussing any longstanding rumors that put him in a bad situation. The following stories show WCW rumors that Hogan wants to avoid talking about.</p><h2 id=forced-wcw-to-give-brutus-beefcake-a-job><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Forced WCW to give Brutus Beefcake a job</span></h2><p>Hulk Hogan’s power and influence were the biggest problems with his WCW tenure. WCW hired Brutus “The Barber” Beefcake with Hogan as his best friend. Hogan reportedly demanded Beefcake get a huge contract as well with a bigger push. Beefcake received a Starrcade main event as The Zodiac against Hogan and it was a huge failure.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>14 Backstage WCW Urban Legends That Were Never Debunked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=received-residuals-for-other-wrestlers-merch><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Received residuals for other wrestlers merch</span></h2><p><a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> started a huge conspiracy theory when discussing his first action figure set in WCW. The first book from Jericho revealed that his wife purchased a figure set of Jericho and Dean Malenko, but the names of Hulk Hogan and Sting were on the receipt. This created the rumor that Hogan was getting the residual money from mid-card wrestlers’ merchandise.</p><h2 id=manipulated-eric-bischoff-to-do-what-he-wanted><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Manipulated Eric Bischoff to do what he wanted</span></h2><p>Eric Bischoff became close with Hulk Hogan in WCW, but many wrestlers resented their friendship. Hogan always got his way with Bischoff listening to him even if it involved other wrestlers. The accusations of Hogan using Bischoff to have more control will always exist when discussing their careers together.</p><h2 id=was-failing-before-nwo-started><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Was failing before nWo started</span></h2><p>The New World Order completely changed the landscape of WCW to finally surpass WWE. However, <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> was in WCW for almost two full years before this heel turn. Various WCW employees revealed Hogan was getting more boos as a face and numbers were trending downhill. Hogan failing as a face may have been the inspiration for the heel run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>14 Storylines WCW Should Have Continued… But Didn’t</a></span></p><h2 id=told-chris-jericho-to-join-wwe><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Told Chris Jericho to join WWE</span></h2><p>Chris Jericho gave us great insight into the WCW life in his first book. Hulk Hogan didn’t have a close relationship with Jericho in WCW, but there was one noteworthy interaction. Jericho saw Hogan at Owen Hart’s funeral and informed him about his plan to head to WWE. Hogan jokingly asked to go with him and told Jericho it was the right move for his career.</p><h2 id=pitched-celebrity-matches-to-avoid-losing-main-event-spot-to-goldberg><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Pitched celebrity matches to avoid losing main event spot to Goldberg</span></h2><p>Goldberg became the WCW Champion during the summer of 1998, but he didn’t main event a PPV until four months into the title reign. Hulk Hogan main evented over Goldberg with tag matches involving celebrities Jay Leno, Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone. The celebrity influence allowed Hogan to remain above Goldberg even when losing the belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=suggested-hiring-ultimate-warrior-to-get-his-win-back><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Suggested hiring Ultimate Warrior to get his win back</span></h2><p>Ultimate Warrior coming to WCW was a strange move since the stint only lasted for a few months. The big angle was Warrior and Hulk Hogan having a rematch to their prior WrestleMania classic. Rumors claim Hogan made Bischoff hire Warrior solely to get his win back. WCW didn’t bring back Warrior after losing to Hogan in an all-time horrible match.</p><h2 id=whipped-david-flair-harder-than-planned><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Whipped David Flair harder than planned</span></h2><p>Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan had heat for years until making peace later in their lives. One of the issues between them stepped from Hogan’s segment with David Flair. The angle was going to see Hogan whip David with a belt to send a message to Ric. Various wrestlers claimed Hogan hit David harder than the average wrestler to upset Ric for real.</p><h2 id=made-money-on-shows-he-didn-t-wrestle-on><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Made money on shows he didn't wrestle on</span></h2><p>Hulk <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogan’s ridiculous WCW contract</a> saw him getting more perks than anyone else in wrestling history. One of the clauses was that Hogan would make a small percentage of the live gate if he was promoted to appear. Hogan rarely ever actually did attend the shows, but he apparently received money from the gate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ruined-bret-hart-s-booking><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ruined Bret Hart's booking</span></h2><p>The horrible booking of Bret Hart remains a huge story when looking back at WCW’s biggest mistakes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hart blames Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff</a> with the belief that they tried to sabotage his career. WCW placing Bret in the New World Order: Hollywood faction as Hogan’s sidekick gives credence to his argument.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Wrestlers Bret Hart Respected (And 8 He Never Liked)</a></span></p><h2 id=knew-about-vince-russo-s-shoot-promo-ahead-of-time><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Knew about Vince Russo's shoot promo ahead of time</span></h2><p>Hulk Hogan’s final appearance in WCW came when Vince Russo cut the infamous shoot promo at Bash at the Beach 2000. Russo claimed Hogan was a cancer to the locker room and berated him harshly. The claims of Russo indicate that Hogan was aware and comfortable with the promo until it happened. Hogan apparently had his feelings hurt and left the company with a lawsuit on the way out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ended-the-wolfpac-s-rise><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ended the Wolfpac's rise</span></h2><p>The popularity of the nWo Wolfpac saw Kevin Nash become a bigger star. WCW icons Sting and Lex Luger joining the trio of Nash, Randy Savage and Konnan made the Wolfpac a huge hit. The split ended with Hulk Hogan’s finger poke of doom reuniting the factions. Hogan gaining power from it made pundits wonder if Hulk’s backstage power was in play here.</p><h2 id=requesting-steve-austin-get-squashed><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Requesting Steve Austin get squashed</span></h2><p>Wrestling fans have wondered for years why Steve Austin didn’t want to work with Hulk Hogan in WWE. Their issues stemmed from Hogan’s early presence in the company. WCW booked Hogan’s friend Jim Duggan to make his debut for WCW by squashing Austin in under a minute to win the United States Champion. Austin’s humiliation proved he was no longer valued in this new era of WCW.</p><h2 id=sabotaging-sting-match><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sabotaging Sting match</span></h2><p>The booking of the infamous Hulk Hogan vs Sting match at Starrcade 1997 is still viewed as a huge disaster. Sting chasing Hogan and the New World Order saw the match booked after a year and a half of build. Starrcade set the WCW box office record for PPV buys, but the strange booking saw the match stop and start. Many critics believed Hogan pitched for this to look stronger in defeat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Wrestling Observer, PW Torch, Death of WCW, Talk is Jericho, 83 Weeks</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The 18 Most Absurd Things That Ever Happened In WCW</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifrqSbYrWws8CnZJ2nlai7tXnWmqWtZaSkeqW10pysrKtdqbWmv8RmaG1lp5jEbr7Upqarq12bv7C5jK2fnmWglsC1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./iyosiasstanaccount-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>iyosiasstanaccount Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./finola-hughes-plastic-surgery-before-and-after-weight-and-health-update.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Finola Hughes Plastic Surgery Before And After: Weight And Health Update</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
