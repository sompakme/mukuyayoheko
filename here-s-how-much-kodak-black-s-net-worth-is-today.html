As of 2020, the female rapper's net worth is estimated to be $24 million. So how about Kodak Black? How much is his net worth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Cardi B’s Meteoric Rise, In Pictures</a></span></p><h2 id=project-baby>Project Baby</h2><p>Kodak Black, born Dieuson Octave, is a Florida native who started his career at the age of 12 with a little known group called Brutal Youngnz. The talented rapper started recording mix tapes of his songs as early as 6 years old in the community trap house of his neighborhood. Reflecting on his difficult childhood, Kodak Black says, "I'm a product of my environment. I grew up in the projects. I'm a project baby. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All the project babies can relate to what I say</a> 'cause they're on the same thing. We're cut from the same cloth, you feel me? We going through the same struggle and all that shit. So, they gonna feel me. And all the other people, they just like what I'm saying. They just like my drive."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-his-current-net-worth>How Much is His Current Net Worth</h2><p>Growing up in abject poverty, Black's intelligent word play and sheer talent brought him to the attention of the big bosses at Atlantic Records. As of 2020, the rapper has a net worth of $600, 000. In an interview, he admits, "I have a huge drive. I was born with nothing. So I always brought up like: go get it. No matter what. Even if its scoping and poking. Rapping and trapping. You know I did it. I switched my whole grind up from doing that, from scoping and poking to just getting in a booth and just doing my thing."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From “Like Will” to “With Will”: Rap Star Asks Will Smith For Movie Role</a></span></p><h2 id=trouble-is-never-far-behind>Trouble is Never Far Behind</h2><p>The troubled 23-year old seems to be a magnet for trouble though. In fact, since 2015, he has had at least 10<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> run-ins with the law</a>. The diverse nature of his crimes range from seemingly minor marijuana raids to more serious ones like sexual assault. Not too proud of this, the rapper says, "When I first started I was rapping about killing and doing all that other s**t, even though I wasn't killing and all that s**t. When I was younger that's where my head was at. " However, he is quick to own up to his mistakes and reflects on his crimes saying, "I kept a clean heart through everything and my intentions wasn't that bad. I didn't just freestyle it. At the end, it's about bread."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leaving school for life on the streets, the rapper may have turned to law-breaking to sustain himself. In an interview, he claims, "I felt like, this is not going to work. Look where I'm from, I don't know nobody, I'm too young. My dad wasn't in my life, he couldn't buy me shit. My mom, her money going was straight to the bills. So I was like, fuck it, I've got to get my own money. At least if I had money in my pocket, I could get some food when I'm hungry."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Rappers That Almost Threw Down With Sports Superstars</a></span></p><h2 id=prison-update-from-his-lawyer>Prison Update From His Lawyer</h2><p>His most recent arrest came right before a show in 2018. He was charged with falsifying documents to purchase firearms, and he is currently serving time in a Miami Prison. Things have not been looking so good for the singer/songwriter, and just this January, there were rumors that he was being mistreated while incarcerated. His lawyer, Bradford Cohen, recently posted an update for the fans of the Florida rapper saying, "I appreciate Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle and her team taking time to listen to what I had to say about Bill. Not only what I had to say about his character, but what I had to say about his treatment. Sometimes you have a prosecutor willing to listen and Dade State Atty Katherine Fernandez Rundle and her team did just that, they listened, they had an opportunity to see my client as a person and not a defendant. It's rare that we can all get together and just talk about the person, putting the facts aside. She really stepped up to the plate and I believe her ears are open to listen, if people are willing to have a discussion."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=positive-outcomes>Positive Outcomes</h2><p>Being in jail has had some positive effects on Kodak Black though. For one, he was able to obtain his GED and as of 2018, he has found renewed spiritual guidance by converting to a different religion. In fact, he now goes by Bill Kahan Kapri and identifies as a Hebrew Israelite. It is rumored that he may be free again by this coming August 2020 after serving his 46-month sentence. The 23-year-old rap genius may get a chance to revive his career again.
