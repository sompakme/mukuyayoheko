It sat on the market for almost a year, according to <a href=#><i>Radar</i></a>.</p><p>The profit from the sale will be used to pay off Erika and Tom’s massive debts. Girardi & Keese has been accused of operating like a Ponzi scheme.</p><p>However, the trustee had been forced to slash the price several times over the course of several months. The asking price was lowered to $11.5 million, then down to $9.98 million and then down to $8.9 million.</p><p>The home sat on the market with no bites and many of the creditors started to show frustration in court — with one demanding the home be sold off immediately for a cash influx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Diana Jenkins Give $100,000 Donation to Families of Lion Air Flight Victims After Erika Jayne Fraud Lawsuit</b></a></span></p><p>As <a href=#><i>Radar</i></a> first reported, Girardi and his law firm were pushed into bankruptcy by his many creditors.

Recently, a court agreed with the “XXpen$ive” singer.</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Los Angeles Magazine</i></a><i>,</i> Erika was dismissed as a defendant in a lawsuit by Judge Richard L.

Tom has a $4.5 million bill to the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>The largest part of his debt is $3.3 million in taxes that he failed to pay in 2019.
