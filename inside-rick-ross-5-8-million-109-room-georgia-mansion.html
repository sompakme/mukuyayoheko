While he initially chose the name Teflon Da Don, he later changed it to Rick Ross, inspired by the drug kingpin ‘Freeway’ Rick Ross. After releasing his single Hustlin, he became a sought-after rapper with multiple record labels trying to bag him until he signed a multi-million dollar deal with <a href=#>Def Jam Records, Jay-Z’s brand</a>. His first album debuted at the top spot, and the rest is history as he sold tens of millions of singles and millions of albums. Counted many times as one of the highest-paid rappers in the world, <a href=#>Rick Ross has a $55 million net worth today</a>.</p><p>Along with owning a fleet of automobiles, Rick Ross likes to spend his fortune on real estate. Over the last two decades, he has purchased several expensive properties in Florida and Georgia. His most expensive home is a $5.8 million Georgia estate he brought from boxer Evander Holyfield that features 109 rooms. Let’s take a look inside the stunning property owned by Rick Ross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-home-that-has-everything>A Home That Has Everything</h2><p>Evander Holyfield was an undisputed cruiserweight champion during the height of his career in the 1980s and had a net worth of over $350 million. After a few losses and dwindling ventures, the former boxer retired to spend time with his family. His Georgia mansion, one of his biggest properties, was high maintenance. However, due to the failed payments, the home was put on auction due to foreclosure as it was expensive to maintain, costing $1 million per year, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. After Holyfield sold the mansion to a bank for $7.5 million, it was put on the market for $8.2 million. Still, the starting price at the auction was $2.5 million, with Ross eventually buying it for $5.8 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Dr. Dre's $40 Million Mega Mansion In Brentwood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Located in Fayetteville County, <a href=#>Georgia, the property</a> was initially constructed in 1994. Spanning a whopping 235 acres, the mansion is 45,000 square feet in size. The magnificent property has a white stone exterior with moldings and a large fountain in the center of the driveway. Upon entrance, all eyes are drawn to the sweeping double-winding dramatic stairway which leads to the rooms upstairs. Amongst the 109 rooms, there are 12 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms.</p><h2 id=a-palace-like-grandiose-to-make-movies>A Palace-Like Grandiose To Make Movies</h2><p>While the home has spacious bedrooms, what truly makes the home stand apart are the recreational rooms around the estate. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleacher Report</a>, the mansion has a massive dining room with a 100-person occupancy, a movie theatre, and even a bowling alley. In addition, the home has three pools: an outdoor pool, an indoor pool, and a hot tub. The huge outdoor pool is the best location to host any pool parties. It takes 350,000 gallons of water to fill its area. The electrical expenses around the massive home cost around $17,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rick Ross’ mansion exudes luxury and has been the perfect property to shoot movies. Over the last several years, two movies were filmed on the property, Superfly in 2018 by Director X and the 2021 romantic comedy Coming 2 America starring Eddie Murphy. Many rooms around the property were transformed to create a suitable setting for the latter film as a sequel. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, renting out the property benefited Ross as he gained a sizeable profit and made a cameo in the movie. In addition, the production team changed his dining room wallpaper while filming and even constructed a dining table that could fit 50 people, which Ross decided to keep.</p><h2 id=a-luxurious-addition-to-his-real-estate-portfolio>A Luxurious Addition To His Real Estate&nbsp;Portfolio</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To suit the needs of the previous owner, Rick Ross’ mansion also featured a separate boxing gym for Evander Holyfield to practice. Additionally, the property has a seven-stall barn, recording studio, baseball field with lights and a scoreboard, and a detached guest house. The property has become a prime example of real estate in Georgia with its supreme features and recreational rooms. The massive garage has ample space to fit Ross’ <a href=#>automobiles, including Rolls Royce Phantom</a> Drophead Coupe, a Lamborghini Murcielago, two Mercedes-Benz cars, and a Ferrari 458 Italia.</p><p>Along with the stunning mansion, Rick Ross has also dabbled with several properties in the past. In 2012, he purchased a waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale for $5.2 million, featuring eight bedrooms and eleven bathrooms. After buying the Georgia mansion, he put the house on sale and sold it for $6 million in 2016, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>Rick Ross hit the jackpot when he bought the palatial estate for only $5.8 million, given the area and amenities offered by the home. In 2020, he spent $1 million to buy a property next to the Georgia mansion, dubbing it the Promise Land. Combining all his houses, he has a total acreage of a whopping 322 acres.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>9 Silicon Valley Moguls Who Have Pledged To Donate Most Of Their Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ50aKapGWipMC0eZRmb2almaG5qrvNZmhpcV2nvLC5jKCcqKqXnq5uucCnqqKnnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mindy-mccready-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mindy McCready Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./geraldine-viswanathan-says-taylor-swift-gave-her-a-purse-when-they-met.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Geraldine Viswanathan Says Taylor Swift Gave Her a Purse When They Met</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
