They be like, [shocked gasp] ‘Megan Thee Stallion…I can not believe she likes to have sex! I cannot believe Megan The Stallion f—ks!’” she said with a laugh. While owning up to that, she did say she was “turning over a new leaf” when it came to the bedroom.</p><p>“I’m stingy with the [sex],” she said in the footage captured by a fan. “I’m not a freak anymore,” said Megan, adding how tired of dating. “I’m done. I’m done with the streets. So toxic in the streets. I’m tired with the streets,” she said.</p><p>The news of Megan’s “freak” moratorium comes after her split from longtime boyfriend <strong>Pardison Fontaine</strong> amid insinuations that Fontaine, 40, was unfaithful. In Megan’s new song, “<a href=#>Cobra</a>,” she rapped about how she caught a former lover in the act with another person.</p><p>“Man, I miss my parents / Way too anxious, always cancel my plans / Pulled up, caught him cheatin’, gettin’ his d–k sucked in the same spot I’m sleepin’ / Lord, give me a break, I don’t know how much more of this s–t I can take,” rapped Megan.</p><p>Fontaine responded with the release of “Thee Person” on November 18. He accused Megan of sleeping with her close friend and music producer <strong>LilJuMadeDaBea</strong>t. Elsewhere on the track, Fontaine said he was going to propose, said Megan had a “ugly soul,” and vented that he was “beefin’ with n—s you know you was f—kin’,” alluding to the <a href=#>public clashes</a> between him and <strong>Tory Lanez</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In December 2022, Megan confirmed that she and Lanez, 31, had a sexual relationship despite publicly denying it. During the trial – over the 2020 incident where <a href=#>Lanez shot at Megan’s feet</a> after a heated argument – the “WAP” rapper said she initially denied the relationship because she was embarrassed. “How could I share my body with someone who could do this to me?” she asked.</p><p>Whereas Megan adopted snake imagery in her “Cobra” music video, the artwork to Fontaine’s single was that of the computer game Snake. However, Pardison’s diss track didn’t win over fans. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Root</a>’s <strong>Candace McDuffie</strong> said that Pardison’s song “[reminds] the public of the simple fact that he can’t rap worth a damn. … Pardi may have tried to embarrass Meg, but the only person he truly embarrassed is himself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSen5GjerW0xJ5krKyRobmqu81mqpqxo2LAqbHSZqWorF2Weqe%2BxJqiZqGeYq%2BmsIyapbKln6eycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicky-hilton-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicky Hilton Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marianne-faithfull-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marianne Faithfull Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
