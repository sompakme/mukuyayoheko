Joel (Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Game of Thrones‘ Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey, as they both must traverse across the U.S. and depend on each other for survival," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> summarized about the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you can imagine, the hype is through the roof for this show.

Well, thanks to having plenty of success on television prior to landing the role, Pascal is going to be making a fortune on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gamer</a>, via Variety, the actor "will earn $6 million for playing Joel during The Last Of Us's first season. Since it has already been confirmed that the show's first season will be ten episodes long, that works out at $600,000 per episode. That figure is apparently before tax, union fees, and anything else that has to come out of it, but it still means Pascal will be taking home a lot of money for his work."</p><p>It is pretty rare for an actor to start off his time on a series making this type of money, but Pedro Pascal brings a significant amount of name value to the project. Not only that, but the series should receive a substantial boost from having a built-in audience thanks to the success of the video game franchise. These two factors have certainly played a part in Pascal's huge salary.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pedro Pascal Introduces ‘Dream Daughter’ To Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will still have to wait until 2023 for the series to make its debut, and with Pascal on board, the project has a great chance of becoming a hit with critics and fans.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Pedro Pascal's 'The Mandalorian' Role</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnpyipHqxrdKcmKVlpJ2ybrjArKtmp5ZiwrR50pqjmqqpZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ring-net-worth-how-much-is-ring-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ring Net Worth How Much is Ring Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neil-cavuto-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Neil Cavuto Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
