Later that month, the “High Low” podcaster and André <a href=#>packed on the PDA while on vacation</a> in the Cayman Islands, exchanging kisses while relaxing on lounge chairs.</p><p>The new fling comes after Us Weekly confirmed in December 2022 that Ratajkowski and<a href=#><strong> Pete Davidson</strong></a> had <a href=#>amicably split after a couple of months</a> of dating. Prior to the breakup, a source exclusively told Us that the Saturday Night Live alum, 29, “loves how intelligent” the I Feel Pretty actress is.</p><p>“There’s no intensity or over-expectation on either side, just a lot of fun and a chance to cut loose and see where it leads,” the insider said at the time, adding that <a href=#>the duo “just dig each other</a> and find the vibe they have very easy and free-flowing.”</p><p>Ratajkowski’s rebound with Davidson came following her July 2022 split from <a href=#><strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard</strong></a> after four years of marriage. The twosome — who tied the knot in February 2018 — share son Sylvester, 23 months.</p><p>The My Body author revealed that she still has her wedding ring and doesn’t<a href=#> view her divorce as a “sad thing”</a> during a January episode of her podcast.</p><p>“Every time I <a href=#>hear a divorce story</a> or when I see the news, I have to remind myself, ‘Oh, that’s sad.’ I literally say to people, ‘Good for you,’” she said.</p><p>The Gone Girl actress has also opened up about how <a href=#>her perspective on dating has changed since her split</a>.</p><p>“I really wanted to be chosen. It was hard for me to go on a date with someone and think about how much I did or didn’t like them,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in October 2022. “I would have been thinking about how they were perceiving me, what it meant, what they wanted from me, what it meant about my self-worth.”</p><p>Ratajkowski continued: “I don’t have that anymore. So, now it’s really fun to go to dinner with someone and be like, ‘Cool. I really enjoyed these parts of them. <a href=#>I really didn’t like these other parts.’”</a></p><p>Davidson, for his part, has since been linked to his Bodies Bodies Bodies costar <a href=#><strong>Chase Sui Wonders</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Pete and Chase <a href=#>had insane chemistry on set</a>,” a source exclusively told Us in January. “As well as when the cameras weren’t rolling.”</p><p>The insider added that the two actors <a href=#>are “absolutely in some kind of relationship</a> but aren’t open about it yet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZmhxm6%2BwK2Yo6OfrMCstYyeqaKbXZa7pb7EZqeoq5Viu7awxGadqKpdq66tsc2toKedo2KxosWO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./explained-why-did-taye-diggs-leave-all-american-season-5.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Explained: Why did Taye Diggs leave All American season 5?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./edgar-ramirez-net-worth-how-much-is-edgar-ramirez-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Edgar Ramirez Net Worth How Much is Edgar Ramirez Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
