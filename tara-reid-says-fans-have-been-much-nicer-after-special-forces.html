It made me a tougher person, and it really was a great show to be on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tara-Reid-Says-Fans-Have-Been-A-Lot-Nicer-to-Her-After-Special-Forces-01.jpg><p>Reid, who said she proved to herself she had “a lot more inner strength” than she thought, also added that she would consider rejoining the show if she had more time to prepare for it.</p><p>“I only got the show three days before we did it,” she explained. “So a lot of people had, like, six months to work on it, and I had three.”</p><p>During the show’s <a href=#>season 2 premiere</a>, Reid’s journey was already off to a rocky start. The Ghosts alum attempted to sneak in a pack of cigarettes after the group’s first task — and was reprimanded for it. She handed over two packs of cigarettes, but Reid was surprised to find a third in her pocket, claiming she “didn’t know it was in there.”</p><p>Reid also compared herself to a “broken bird” and added that she wants to “have thicker skin and not let people bother me so much.”</p><p>“I get bullied a lot and stuff, and I just wanted to make myself a stronger person, and I thought this could help. Everyone says, ‘She got so old looking, she looks bad, she looks like s—t.’ And just this s—t that goes on social media and stuff like that,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reid has been candid about her struggles with addiction through the years. In 2008, Reid went to rehab and completed a 60-day program.</p><p>“I didn’t like the person I was. I was sad and conflicted,” she said to In Touch in 2014. “I went there by myself. I put myself there. It was the greatest decision I ever made. Rehab saved my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuaqpFiv6a1w2aqmrGjYrOiutJmn5qulWKvprHNZqSum5hiu6qvxKtkmp6kmr9uv8%2BemqKZnGKzsL7Cnqpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-sylvester-stallone-jennifer-flavin-get-back-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Sylvester Stallone &amp;amp; Jennifer Flavin Get Back Together?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rasheeda-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rasheeda Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
