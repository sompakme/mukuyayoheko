These movies make people want to flock to the box office to buy tickets so that they can be the first people to find out what is happening next in the franchise. The coolest thing about the MCU is that they often follow traditional comic book stories. Here’s what the cast looked like before they got famous.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Robert Downey Jr.</span></h2><p class=p1>Iron Man is played by none other than <a href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a> who does an excellent job of playing such a conceited and cocky character. Iron Man is known for being a bit full of himself since he is a bonafide genius. Iron Man was able to build his own suit and replace his own bodily organs in order to preserve his life! He definitely deserves to be a little cocky. here's proof that before he was famous, Robert Downey Jr. looked absolutely adorable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-johansson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Scarlett Johansson</span></h2><p class=p1>Black Widow is played by the lovely and talented <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>. As an adult actress, her fans have seen her change her hair color from blonde to red to brown many times. As a youngster though, she was known for having dark brown hair. Scarlett Johansson was already famous before landing the role of Black Widow but the role of Black Widow is certainly what pushed her over the edge in terms of notoriety in the Hollywood industry.</p><h2 id=chris-evans><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Chris Evans</span></h2><p class=p1>Captain America is played by <a href=#>Chris Evans</a>, one of the most handsome actors in the Hollywood industry. He has such an all-American handsomeness to him that it is hard to find someone who doesn’t find him absolutely attractive! When he was younger, he looked super adorable too. He definitely grew up to become one of the most handsome men in the entire Marvel franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-ruffalo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mark Ruffalo</span></h2><p>Before <a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a> played the role of the Hulk, Eric Bana and Edward Norton took their turns as the big green monstrous hero. Mark Ruffalo is the actor people recognize and know in the role the most as of today. Before landing the role of the Hulk, Mark Ruffalo was already deep into his acting career. And before he was an actor, he was an extremely handsome teenager!</p><h2 id=lupita-nyong-o><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lupita Nyong'o</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Lupita Nyong’o</a> is the actress who plays the role of Nakia in Black Panther. She played the love interest in the movie starring the late Chadwick Boseman. As a youngster, she was absolutely adorable and probably had huge hopes and dreams for her future.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lupita Nyong'o Shares Endearing Tribute To Chadwick Boseman And Fans Are In Tears</a></span></p><p class=p1>Whatever she thought she could achieve as a child, she was right about it. She is not one of the most talked-about and adored actresses in the Marvel cinematic universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-reynolds><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ryan Reynolds</span></h2><p class=p1>Deadpool is played by the hilarious and handsome Ryan Reynolds. Playing the role of Deadpool was so important to him that he was willing to fund the first movie on his own just to bring it to life.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What Ryan Reynolds Had To Go Through To Be 'Deadpool'</a></span></p><p class=p1>He wanted to make it happen so bad! Deadpool was years in the making but when it finally was filmed and released, it ended up being a success. The humor in Deadpool definitely pushes the boundaries of what is appropriate but for fans who are old enough, it is so worth watching.</p><h2 id=chris-pratt><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Pratt</span></h2><p>Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy is played by <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a> who was still handsome as a teenager but still looked quite dorky with his braces on! Chris Pratt grew up to become one of the most good-looking actors ever. Aside from being known in his role as*Lord, he is also known for his role in parks and recreation alongside Aubrey Plaza and Amy Poehler. He is known for being a comedic actor, but he can also be very serious too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-marsden><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>James Marsden</span></h2><p class=p1>Cyclops from the X-Men movies was played by James Marsden in the early 2000s. James Marsden still has the same adorable smile with the same dimples today that he had when he was a teenager. One thing that is definitely different would have to be his hairstyle… And thankfully so! His teenage hairstyle was definitely not the right move. He has grown up and styles his hair in a way that is much more suitable.</p><h2 id=zoe-saldana><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Zoe Saldana</span></h2><p class=p1>The character of Gamora is played by <a href=#>Zoe Saldana</a>. Since she wears green skin make-up all over her body in the Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise, it’s hard to really see just how beautiful she is. When she isn’t dressed up in the green body paint for her role, it is obvious to take note of just how beautiful Zoe Saldana really is. And she was still beautiful as a teenager— just take a look at the picture above!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-holland><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tom Holland</span></h2><p>Other actors who have taken on the role of Spiderman in the past include Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Most recently, Tom Holland is the actor who has taken on the heroic MCU role. Tom Holland is still very young seeing as he is only 24 years old but when he was even younger, he was still just as adorable and ready for the spotlight. His being cast as Spiderman was definitely the right choice.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Guardians Of The Galaxy Star' Zoe Saldana Said This About Britney Spears' Downfall</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYycmKysXaSzbsDHnmSmm6ViubC7yp6bZqSZoLJursSfpqudXam1psWMsJyrnV2brq671Kxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zerkaa-biography-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zerkaa Biography And Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-of-netflix-s-the-adam-project-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Cast Of Netflix's 'The Adam Project,' Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
