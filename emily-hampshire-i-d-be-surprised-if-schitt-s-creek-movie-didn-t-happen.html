We’ll never do the show again, but I would be surprised if we didn’t all get together for some kind of special.”</p><p><a href=#>Everything ‘Schitt’s Creek’ Cast Has Said About a Movie</a></p><p>Cocreator Levy, 38, has been <a href=#>teasing a possible cast reunion</a> since the beloved Pop TV series came to an end in April 2020 after six seasons. In May 2021, Murphy, 35, told Us that she had “not heard back about a movie officially” at that point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Schitts-Creeks-Emily-Hampshire-Jokes-Stevie-Might-Be-Pregnant-in-Possible-Movie3.jpg><p>“But, oh, my God, I would be just over the moon if that ever came to pass because I miss everyone so much every day,” she gushed at the time. “I just want to see everyone on screen again and I will be a happy camper. … We were very lucky to have an amazing group of writers on this show.”</p><p>Although Murphy told Us she doesn’t think her Alexis Rose would be having kids just yet, it’s the complete opposite for Hampshire’s Stevie Budd.</p><p><a href=#>Costars Reunited Through the Years</a></p><p>“I’m not suggesting this, but for some reason I have had dreams that sometimes we’re doing the show again and Stevie’s pregnant. And I’m like, ‘Where did this come from!?’ And I’d wake up in a sweat, like, in this nightmare,” the Chapelwaite actress revealed to Us. “That’s some unconscious nightmare thing. So if Stevie is pregnant, it’s not my fault. I had that dream a bunch of times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Schitts-Creeks-Emily-Hampshire-Jokes-Stevie-Might-Be-Pregnant-in-Possible-Movie2.jpg><p>Schitt’s Creek ended with Stevie staying behind with David Rose (Levy) and Patrick Brewer (<strong>Noah Reid</strong>) while Alexis headed to New York City and Johnny Rose (<a href=#><strong>Eugene Levy</strong></a>) and Moira Rose (<a href=#><strong>Catherine O’Hara</strong></a>) flew to L.A. to launch the Rosebud Motel franchise.</p><p><a href=#>Fictional TV Hometowns</a></p><p>“I love that decision because I feel like the obvious choice in what most shows would do is have Stevie go off to New York and become a big success in the motel industry. And what I love is she didn’t have to go anywhere to be a success,” she told Us. “It’s kind of like The Wizard of Oz. You always had it in you, you just had to see it for yourself. Like she just had to see that she could go somewhere else and then you realize she loves it there. She didn’t need to. So I would want to see her still there.”</p><p><a href=#>The cast has remained close since saying goodbye</a> to the show — <a href=#>and sweeping the Emmys</a> in 2020 with nine wins. Their group text chains have also helped them stay in contact, but don’t expect O’Hara, 67, to be too involved.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Actors Who Portrayed Real People in Film and TV</a></p><p>“We can’t do it with Eugene and Catherine because <a href=#>Catherine has an iPhone 4s!</a> It’s not even an Android,” Hampshire told Us. “It makes everything green because even the 4s doesn’t want to admit that it’s an iPhone. If you put her on the text chain no one gets the messages, and it screws it all up. So [we] leave them out. And I think Eugene, it takes him a long time to send something back. So we leave him out. We leave them out and we just have our own little text chain. I <a href=#>text Annie all the time and Sarah [Levy] [too].</a> We have our girl chain.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJymoZyueqmtzKmqoaGimnqqsIybnGarpae9s7XSnptmoZZiwKS0yK2rrGWTp7Kmt4ympq%2BhlWKxqrDNrWShmaClsq97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kourtney-kardashian-says-she-s-only-skinny-when-she-s-unhappy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kourtney Kardashian Says She's Only &amp;quot;Skinny&amp;quot; When She's Unhappy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-andrew-garfield-and-jamie-dornan-still-friends-after-fame.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Andrew Garfield And Jamie Dornan Still Friends After Fame?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
