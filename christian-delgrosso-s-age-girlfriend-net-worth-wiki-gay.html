Wiki Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian DelGrosso was born in Toronto, Ontario Canada, on 24 May 1993, so his zodiac sign is Gemini and he holds Canadian nationality. He is a YouTuber and a former Viner, best known for his now defunct Vine account onto which he uploaded hit short funny videos.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-education></span>Early life and education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian was raised in Canada by his mother who was working two jobs, and can often be seen featured in Christian’s videos on YouTube – it appears that his father wasn’t present while he was growing up. Christian has a younger brother named Julian and the two attended the same high school, where they were physically active as they both played football, while Christian was also a member of the school’s drama club, appearing in nearly all school plays.</p><p>While attending 11th grade he became interested in comedy, and started watching stand-up comedians perform on YouTube, becoming a huge fan of Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell. Upon matriculation, Christian decided to pursue an acting career rather than a college degree, and began learning how to act at EVN Studios.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-as-an-actor-and-a-social-media-star></span>Career as an actor and a social media star<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian started working at the age of 18 at a local sandwich store, while simultaneously taking care of his Vine account, uploading his 6-second long funny videos on a daily basis.</p><p>Shortly before the website was shutdown, Christian has built a following of over 7.6 million, making him one of the most popular people on the platform. He launched his YouTube channel on 27 December 2013 but didn’t commit to it until Vine went down. There are currently over 2.74 million people subscribed to the channel while it counts over 475 million views of all his videos combined – Christian’s most viewed video entitled “Funniest Kid Test Answers! (Top 10)” was uploaded on 14 January 2017, and has been watched nearly 20 million times.</p><p>Christian is also an Instagram star, as his account is followed by over three million people, onto which he’s uploaded more than 1,200 pictures, and he is also popular on Twitter, counting over 1.2 million followers.</p><p>He sees himself more as an actor than a comedian or a social media celebrity, and appeared in the comedy film “Mono” in 2016, which stars Ty Parker, Sam Lerner and Sarah De La Isla, and talks about a mono virus which only attacks popular kids at Highland Park High, allowing the outcasts to takeover the school.</p><p>His next appearance was in the comedy film “Internet Famous”, released on 21 June 2016, which stars Shane Dawson and Steve Greene, and follows the story of several social media stars who are invited to participate in a talent contest, although none of them has any talent. He went on to appear in the movie “Disconnected” (also known as “Blue Weekend”) in 2017, as well as in “School Spirits” in the same year. He has recently moved to Los Angeles, California to work on his way up in the film industry.</p><p>Christian has worked on branded campaigns too, for numerous companies which are famous worldwide, such as Universal Studios, Pepsi, and Google among many others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=love-life-and-relationships-is-he-gay></span>Love life and relationships. Is he gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There were rumors circulating the internet that the popular actor and internet star is gay, however, these turned out to be false after he began uploading pictures onto his Instagram account with his long-term girlfriend Kristen McGowan. Kristen is an interior stylist and a YouTuber, who launched her channel on 19 November 2016, which is currently subscribed to by over 350,000 people – part of her description reads ‘Kristen McGowan is an ambitious, positive, and creative young woman! She graduated with her Bachelors of Interior Design, and is ready to share all of her Interior design, home decor, DIY, and lifestyle tips & tricks with the world!’</p><p>Both Kristen and Christian often upload pictures and videos of themselves together onto their Instagram accounts, while Christian has recently wished her a happy Valentine’s Day, with part of his caption reading ‘Happy Valentine’s Day to my best friend, the Love of my life, and the person who understands me the most @kristenmcgowan. I love you more than life itself.’</p><p>The two are living together in Los Angeles, and rumor has it that Christian has recently proposed to Kristen, to which she reportedly said ‘yes’.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hobbies-and-other-interests></span>Hobbies and other interests<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian is a huge fan of the film industry, and two of his favorite actors are Eddie Murphy and Rowan Atkinson, while two of his favorite movies are “The Notebook” and “Liar Liar”. He also enjoys reading books in his spare time, with his favorite writer being Nicholas Sparks and his favorite book “The Notebook”, stating that the book is a bit better than the movie. He likes to travel, and has been to several states in the US and to Europe on several occasions, visiting countries such as France, Italy and Spain.</p><p>Christian is a lover of animals, and he and his girlfriend have two cats which can occasionally be seen featured in his pictures on Instagram. He likes tattoos and has several inked onto his arms. Christian is physically active having several training sessions at the gym each week, while he is also sporting as he plays football and drives a go kart.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=appearance-and-net-worth></span>Appearance and net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian is 26 years old. He has short brown hair and brown eyes, is 5ft 11ins (1.8m) tall, and weighs around 163lbs (74kgs). As of early 2020, his net worth is estimated at over $2 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0wMiapWaclaG0s7vSrKasZZGcsm6zyKujn6qZmrulec2eq2avn6fBqXnWoqKiZZeWxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danielle-brooks-threw-her-back-out-while-filming-the-color-purple.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Danielle Brooks Threw Her Back Out While Filming 'The Color Purple'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-crist-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Crist Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
