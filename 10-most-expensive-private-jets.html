These things are so expensive that not everyone that is rich has the privilege to own one of these. But the question still remains up in the air, “Which planes are the most expensive? And who owns them?”</p><p>In this list, we’ll go over the 10 most expensive private jets in the world. Some of them are owned by world-famous politicians and businessmen, with some anonymous big-timers that didn’t want their names associated with their jets. We could understand that move with all the things that these planes included.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Perfumes In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=boeing-757--100-million>Boeing 757- ($100 million)</h2><p><a href=#>It should come as no surprise</a> that Donald Trump owns this one. He bought it from Paul Allen, one of Microsoft’s co-founders. Once Donald got his hands on this, he did everything in his power to give it that Trump-like appeal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can expect to find the thing covered in gold, and his electronics department in the plane is nowhere lacking. His bathrooms feature marble countertops, and the gold finds its way onto the seatbelts. He also has the glossiest walnut tables throughout the plane with his family's last name engraved on almost every surface. What else would you expect from him?</p><h2 id=gulfstream-iii-125-million>Gulfstream III ($125 million)</h2><p>A fan of Tyler Perry movies? They certainly netted him a pretty comfortable profit and he can laugh on his way to the bank. Which is how he was able to afford this mega-expensive method of travel. It features a 42-inch HD TV that comes with multiple Blu-ray players that pair exceptionally well with its satellite TV capabilities.</p><p>The windows also have electronically controlled window shades. That’s not all. The plane includes a full bathroom for taking showers, and if you’re hungry you can always use the full kitchen. It’s very easy to see why it's as much as it is&nbsp;and with that kind of price-tag,</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Luxurious Saunas</a></span></p><h2 id=boeing-747-8-vip-150-million>Boeing 747-8 VIP ($150 million)</h2><p>This is the second-largest and longest airliner that has ever been built. It can fly for 8,000 miles nonstop, and its indoor cabin is 4,786-sq ft. Inside, it houses lounges, a stateroom, office, and a massive dining room. This model was based on the smaller Airbus A320 series, and its engine can take you over 800 mph.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Talk about speed and luxury. This plane could pass as a house all on its own, it’s more than spacious enough to, and why not spend a night or two in it after <a href=#>dropping a steep $150 million on it?</a> It should be comfy!</p><h2 id=boeing-747-81-vip-153-million>Boeing 747-81 VIP ($153 million)</h2><p>This massive model is owned by Joseph Lau, an extremely successful real estate tycoon. Its a part of the “Dreamliner” series and it sells itself with everything that it includes for the <a href=#>hefty price of $153 Million</a>.</p><p>Everything in the cabin is top-notch. Ever think you would see vaulted ceilings in a plane? What about spiral staircases and video displays that take up the entire wall? We may not know what else Lau owns, but this plane gives us a pretty good idea of the style that the man surrounds himself with. This VIP plane is one of the cheapest on our list.</p><h2 id=boeing-767-33a-120-170-million>Boeing 767-33A ($120-170 million)</h2><p>According <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to Forbes</a>, Roman Abramovich is the 9th richest man in Russia, and that alone should tell you what type of style this man likes. This plane dubbed “The Bandit” gets its name from the smoky cock-pit. It is said to look like an ordinary plane on the outside, but it is decked out with chestnut wood and decorated thoroughly with gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This plane was intended to be purchased by Hawaiin Airlines, but Roman snatched it up the second that the order fell through. He made personal changes to it, and the inside is rarely ever available to be seen by the public.</p><h2 id=boeing-747-400-200-million>Boeing 747-400 ($200 million)</h2><p>This plane belongs to the richest man in Saudi Arabia. <a href=#>That means that the $220 million</a> it took to purchase this plane was pocket change for him. If this plane encounters any kind of problem, he has his “Hawker,” a support plane that he bought to counter any trouble or emergencies in the air.</p><p>He has 11 international flight attendants that travel with him at a moment's notice, and to help his ego, he also has many of his biographies scattered around the plane for others to read. It’s reported that the books are mainly found in the planes “living room.”</p><h2 id=boeing-747-430-223-million>Boeing 747-430 ($223 million)</h2><p>The Sultan of Brunei is said to be one of the richest men in the world. You know how millionaires may boast about their fleet of cars? The Sultan does the same thing, but with all of his private jets. <a href=#>The least he could have paid for this aircraft is $100 million</a> (yes, we said lowest. We’re envious too).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then spent another $120 million to decorate the plane to his liking. This means some pretty lavish furniture and high-tech electronics. It even has wash bins of solid gold and multiple Lalique crystals that are repeatedly implemented in everything, giving the plane even more of a luxurious feel.</p><h2 id=airbus-a340-300-250-million>Airbus A340-300 ($250 million)</h2><p>Ever heard of Metalloinvest? It’s Russia’s biggest iron-ore producer, and its CEO, Alisher Usmanov had $500 million to drop on some fancy transportation. He bought the plane after selling his Facebook shares for<a href=#> an unbelievable $1.4 billion</a>.</p><p>The Airbus A340 is a standard $250 million for those wanting to buy it. He then dropped another $250 million to personalize it to his standards. He is one of the richest men in Russia, and his plane is known to be the biggest jet in Russia, if not in all of Europe. That really speaks of the luxury hidden inside, that no one really gets to see.</p><h2 id=airbus-a380--custom-500-million>Airbus A380- Custom ($500 million)</h2><p>The Airbus A380 is considered one of the biggest jets in the world. It can seat up to 853 passengers, giving you your own airline essentially. Prince Al Waleed bought this for $300 million and decided the only reasonable thing to do next is to pay $200 million more to decorate it to suit his tastes. Inside is a dining table that can seat up to 14 people, with a ‘magic’ carpet that fills the plane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It comes with a lounge area for him to relax, and if he is feeling tired on his flights, he can choose one of the two full bedrooms to sleep in. That’s not all, the plane even features a concert hall for his friend’s entertainment.</p><h2 id=boeing-747-refit-617-million>Boeing 747 refit ($617 million)</h2><p>As of writing, this is the single most expensive private jet ever sold, <a href=#>but we have not one clue who it belongs to</a>. This plane comes with eight fully furnished bedrooms on the top level, multiple lounge areas, and even an on-board restaurant for the billionaire to eat at when they’re hungry.</p><p>The table inside can seat 15 people, and the preferred color of the billionaire is apparently beige. Luxury flatscreens can be seen in almost every room of the plane. The reason for the cost? Because the billionaire wanted it to be a home away from home, and with the amount they dropped on it, it’s safe to say that it has more than the potential to be.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Diamond Rings</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yoqq1lla29prrSoq2eZaCntret055ko52kqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boy-meets-world-news-us-weekly.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boy Meets World News - Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tina-turner-tributes-from-janet-jackson-lizzo-mariah-carey-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tina Turner Tributes from Janet Jackson, Lizzo, Mariah Carey and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
