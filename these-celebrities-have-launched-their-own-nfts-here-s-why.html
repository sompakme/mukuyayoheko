After all, why would you pay millions of dollars for a crypto artwork? The climate surrounding this new technology has been controversial, with many wondering if it's just a modern-day form of a money laundering scheme. The most famous of them all, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> and CryptoPunks, has a plethora of star owners including <strong><a href=#>Eminem</a></strong>, Timbaland, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, and more.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Celebrity Has Eminem Dissed The Most In His Music?</a></span>Some people hate NFTS, some people love them. As the world is slowly shifting into digital, so are these celebrities. Over the past few months, celebrities have been quite active in the digital market, launching their own NFTs under crazy price tags. Here are some of the A-list musicians and actors who joined the digital universe with their NFTs and how well are they selling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Eminem</span></h2><p>In April 2021, rapper Eminem launched his debut set of NFTs, "Shady Con," through NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway. The drop features original instrumental beats by the rapper himself and a few other collectibles, inspired by the rapper's vintage addiction to collections. "The tracks will be made available <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only as part of the limited-edition and one-of-a-kind NFT</a>s…But this only scratches the surface of what’s coming this weekend!" the official press release reads.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Snoop Dogg</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Snoop Dogg is no stranger to some of the most bizarre collaborations, so when he teamed up with Clay Nation to launch an NFT collection on the Cardano blockchain in April this year, no one was really surprised. It wasn't his first collection, either. Back in March 2021, he announced his debut limited-edition NFT drop "A Journey with the Dogg," which takes inspiration from "memories from his early years with art."</p><p>"I always like to be on the cutting edge and my team stays ahead of the curve. We have been following the movement for a while, so we were actually ahead of the pandemonium. When I saw that I could create original art, tell a story, and combine it with an original track I was all in," he told Vanity Fair, adding, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I plan to continue to engage with the fans who buy this artwork. </a>There is no platform or middleman filtering my message anymore. They get to own an original and limited piece from the Dogg. They can collect, display, trade it. We just getting started."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lindsay Lohan</span></h2><p>After chaotic years of non-stop drama, Lindsay Lohan is slowly blueprinting her comeback to the music. In March 2021, the pop star deep-dived into the NFT world by releasing her first-ever single in a year, "Lullaby," as an NFT on Fansforever. The auction itself ended at around $32,000, which isn't that bad at all!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan’s Biggest Scandals And How She's Making Her Hollywood Comeback</a></span></p><h2 id=shawn-mendes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Shawn Mendes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Canadian powerhouse singer, Shawn Mendes released his fourth studio album Wonder in 2020, he also launched digital wearables NFT as a companion to the album. He was partnering up with Genies, a company that designs 2D avatars of some of the world's top clients. It was quite a strange creative choice, but all the proceedings go to his Shawn Mendes Foundation.</p><h2 id=brie-larson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Brie Larson</span></h2><p>This year, Captain Marvel star Brie Larson became the latest Hollywood star to join the digital universe. While she hasn't technically launched her very own NFT collection yet, the 32-years-old has been quite active in the metaverse in the past few months. However, she sparked controversy when she promoted her "my lil corner of the @some_place metaverse" last March, and it's safe to say that her fans didn't really support that decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Is Brie Larson Getting Ripped For 'The Marvels'?</a></span></p><h2 id=paris-hilton><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paris Hilton</span></h2><p>Back in April 2021, socialite Paris Hilton debuted her own NFTs featuring three unique pieces, "Hummingbird in my metaverse" and "Legends of love," which featured 11 editions, and the one-and-only rare "Iconic Crypto Queen." She managed to raise $1.11 million, and she's not stopping there. A year later, she launched a series of autobiographical NFTs and dubbed it "Paris: Past Live, New Beginnings" on the Origin Story marketplace.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Justin Bieber</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In December 2021, <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber </a></strong>joined the NFT world by debuting his first collection, gummy, and linked up with the inBetweeners NFT project. In addition to that, he's no stranger to buying Bored Ape NFTs, as he added another one to his collection for 166 ETH back in February this year, which is currently worth around $470k. In total, he has over 600 NFTs in his collection!</p><h2 id=steve-aoki><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Steve Aoki</span></h2><p>Lastly, there's Steve Aoki who even said that he'd collected more in the bank through NFTs than what he did through his 10 years of music. “But if I was to really break down, OK, in the 10 years I’ve been making music… six albums, and you [combine] all those advances, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what I did in one drop last year in NFTs, I made more money.</a> And also, I was way more unhinged with music,” he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Are Justin Bieber's Most Hated Songs (And Why Fans Dislike Them)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmv8RmpK6rmZi2orrSZpicrJ%2BnwG64wK6lnKCVmXqvstOsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toya-turner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toya Turner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sage-the-gemini-begs-jordin-sparks-to-return-his-calls-in-vulnerable-instagram-message.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sage The Gemini Begs Jordin Sparks To Return His Calls In Vulnerable Instagram Message</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
