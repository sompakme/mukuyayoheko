The stars of the modern flicks are all quite successful, and each has an impressive net worth.</p><p>Let’s take a look and see which&nbsp;Jumanji star has the highest net worth.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-is-number-one-with-400-million>Dwayne Johnson Is Number One With $400 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F5AA72E6-69A5-4E0F-B912-5D064D6790FE.png><p>When taking a look at the primary member of the&nbsp;Jumanji cast, only one person can lay claim to having the highest net worth. In a surprise to no one, Dwayne Johnson is sitting on top with a gargantuan $400 million net worth, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson is one of the most popular figures on the planet these days, and he has been putting in an obscene amount of work to get to where he is now. He got his start in the world of professional wrestling back in the 90s, eventually becoming one of the biggest WWE stars of all time. However, his charisma was simply too big for the ring, and when Hollywood came knocking, Dwayne cashed in.</p><p>It wasn’t always the smoothest process, but Dwayne Johnson now has a slew of blockbuster hits under his belt. Thanks to&nbsp;Ballers, he also has a successful television project, which has only made him more money. In fact, Johnson can command upwards of $20 million for a single movie.</p><p>On top of this work on the big and small screen, he is also making bank by landing major endorsement deals with companies like Under Armour. Still not impressed? Johnson is also building up his Teremana company, which is off to a record-breaking start for a spirit company. Yeah, the guy is a money-making machine, and there is still plenty of room to grow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As impressive as this is, his&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;co-stars are doing quite well for themselves.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Jack Black Actually Inspired The Creation Of 'School Of Rock'</a></span></p><h2 id=kevin-hart-is-sporting-200-million>Kevin Hart Is Sporting $200 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/44A0FDAE-7BDA-4925-B1F1-87D9599A4F6C.jpeg><p>Kevin Hart, on top of being one of the most successful comedic actors of his era, is also a stand-up comedy titan who is capable of selling out major venues on any given night. Hart has built his brand up into a genuine powerhouse, and according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the star is sporting a $200 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t always smooth for Kevin Hart, as many people have thankfully forgotten all about&nbsp;Soul Plane, but through hard work and finding the right roles, the performer has become an A-list star. This, in turn, proved to be a huge boost for his comedy career. In fact,&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth shows that Hart was able to bank up to $70 million per year in touring alone. Few comedians on the planet can come anywhere close to matching that number.</p><p>Comedy alone has made him bank, but Hart’s time on the big screen is making him millions, as well. The actor has been in huge movies like&nbsp;Ride Along, Central Intelligence, The Secret Life of Pets,&nbsp;and more. The success of these movies combined with his comedy and other business interests have made Hart worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Hart and Johnson are worth the most at this point, and thanks to some huge successes, their fellow stars are good to go.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Did Karen Gillan Make For 'Guardians Of The Galaxy'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jack-black-has-50-million-and-karen-gillan-is-at-2-million>Jack Black Has $50 Million, And Karen Gillan Is At $2 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3F8329F0-3347-401B-8614-E9F163278407.jpeg><p>Comedic powerhouse Jack Black clocks in at the third spot of the main cast with a $50 million net worth. This may seem small when compared to Johnson and Hart, but a $50 million net worth is an unbelievably impressive number for any person to have. Black has achieved this after years of making music and movies.</p><p>The bulk of Black’s fortune has been made on the big screen. Thanks to huge projects like&nbsp;Shallow Hal, School of Rock, Tropic Thunder,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Kung Fu Panda franchise, Black has racked up the money and the love of fans around the world. On top of this, he has also done quite well for himself in the world of music with his band, Tenacious D. They have sold loads of records and have played huge shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a $2 million net worth, Karen Gillan comes in below the other three stars of the movie. While this number is not what some would expect, it is only going to grow over time. Gillan already has the&nbsp;Jumanji and&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;franchises to her name, not to mention&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Yeah, this number is going to explode in the coming years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Kevin Hart And J.T.
