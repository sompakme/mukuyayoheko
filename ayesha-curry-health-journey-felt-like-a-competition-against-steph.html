And it took me so long to realize, ‘No, my fitness journey and my plan are gonna look how that looks for me.’”</p><p>When it comes to her <a href=#>health and fitness</a> routines, the mother of three said she focuses less on “high-intensity workouts” and doesn’t do “the diet thing.” As she explained, “It’s living that 80/20 life and making sure that I’m enjoying life’s celebratory moments, and then, in between, making healthier choices. For me, it couldn’t be so rigid, and I found the best results when I kind of loosened up a little bit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ayesha-Curry-Reveals-Competing-With-Husband-Steph-Curry-Was-a-Hindrance-on-Her-Health-Journey-2.jpg><p>Ray, 54, couldn’t agree more with the actress’ statements, as she told her guest, “You can’t keep up with Steph and you shouldn’t. Everybody’s different. Whether you’re a man or a woman or old or young, you gotta find the thing that’s right for you.”</p><p>Ayesha previously revealed in May 2020 that she <a href=#>lost 35 pounds while quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. “I started my fitness journey because I wanted to be strong and healthy for myself and the people who depend on me,” the cookbook author captioned a <a href=#>July 2020 Instagram post</a>. “But it was important that I did it my way, which meant I needed working out to fit in my life, NOT take me away from it.”</p><p>She went on to note that she doesn’t believe “there’s any formula that works for everyone,” but that she does believe “that creating time for yourself to exercise is never time wasted.”</p><p>“I went to work finding ways to incorporate healthy habits into my busy schedule,” the International Smoke restaurant owner added, “and picked up a few tricks along the way (easy 10-minute workouts, fast healthy recipes, etc.).”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She showed off her hard work by posing for pics in a gray bikini. “Took me long enough,” she captioned the <a href=#>Instagram photos in May 2020</a>, also noting that Steph was the photographer.</p><p>Several of Ayesha’s celebrity friends showed their love for the star <a href=#>in the comments section</a>, including <a href=#><strong>Gabrielle Union</strong></a>, who wrote, “Alrighty. Lemme get my life together.” <a href=#><strong>Ali Wong</strong> </a>commented “WOW,” while <a href=#><strong>Jordyn Woods</strong></a> dubbed her friend a “Skinnnnny minnny.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaasZWotaJ5wq6pq7FdnbKiuNOhZKOnpae7psWMn5ylrF2htqyxjJpknKedpbK1tdOipqdlkZyuqrrSrWSsrJWltXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bret-hart-writes-about-the-passing-of-andrew-test-martin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bret Hart Writes About The Passing Of Andrew Test Martin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-sullivan-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Sullivan Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
