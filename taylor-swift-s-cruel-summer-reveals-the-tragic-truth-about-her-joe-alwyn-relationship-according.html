It not only has a great, catchy beat, but the lyrics are compelling and intense. Ever since Swift's album <strong>"Lover" was released in 2019</strong>, fans were drawn to this particular tune.</p><p>Although fans always try to guess what the beloved star is singing about, one fan had an especially fascinating interpretation of Taylor Swift's "Cruel Summer." According to this fan, the beautifully written lyrics could be referring to the start of her romance with <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>. From this interpretation, it's possible to say that the alleged problems between them were there all along.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-39-cruel-summer-39-could-be-about-her-dramatic-relationship-with-joe-alwyn>Taylor Swift's 'Cruel Summer' Could Be About Her Dramatic Relationship With Joe Alwyn</h2><p>Taylor Swift's "Cruel Summer" could be interpreted as a summer fling that is as fun as it is intense and painful. If fans view it through the lens of the singer's breakup with Joe Alwyn, they can assume that perhaps it tells the story of why they ended their six-year romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift-bought-a-massive-mansion-before-splitting-up-where-does-joe-live-now_.jpg><p>Redditor @kalimdore posted in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift SubReddit</a> and shared their theory about "Cruel Summer." They wrote:</p><p>"It’s about summer (mostly late summer) 2016 when she was secretly seeing Joe. They were casually hooking up no strings attached because it “wasn’t a good time” for her rep lol and both of them didn’t want the media to get wind of anything."</p><p>The fan continued, "So they were not in a relationship, he was likely hooking up with other girls in between and she was trying to pretend she felt the same chill way about it." According to this fan, Swift developed strong and real feelings for Alwyn quickly, but the romance wasn't official yet. But since she liked him so much, this meant that the situation could end in heartbreak, which it definitely did when <strong>Alwyn and Swift broke up in 2023</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fan continued, "She knew it was dangerous to get close to someone she liked so much. Playing a game that would hurt her if she fell for him whilst pretending she was just in it for the fun. Devils roll the dice, basically taking a dangerous but exciting gamble on getting close to him, angels roll their eyes because they know they’ve lost her to this."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-s-most-quotable-lyrics-ranked-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Quotable Lyrics Ranked, According To Reddit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Since the start of her career with Tim McGraw, and now with her 'Taylor's Version' albums, Swift has had some of the most quotable song lyrics.</span><p>According to this fan, Taylor Swift's "Cruel Summer" refers to a big "secret." They wrote, "The secret is more her feelings from him, but probably also their relationship from the public/media." This is a fascinating take and could explain why Swift and Alwyn broke up: because it became too tough to date someone who is so famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/did-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-s-breakup-alter-her-2023-tour-or-just-set-it-up-for-incredible-success_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since <strong>Swift hasn't explained the reason behind her split from Alwyn</strong>, this is just speculation. However, a source did tell People in April 2023 that "Joe has struggled with Taylor's level of fame and the attention from the public." Several Reddit fans agreed that "Cruel Summer" seems to be about Swift struggling with the hidden nature of their romance when they first dated in the summer. Redditor @leila5887 wrote that they listen to the song now "with the context of joe wanting a private relationship."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-15-most-popular-songs-spotify-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's top Spotify streams will likely be changing since she announced her new album, 'The Tortured Poets Department' will be released soon.</span><p><strong>Taylor Swift's "Cruel Summer" Lyrics</strong></p><ul><li>"So cut the headlights, summer's a knife</li><li>I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone</li><li>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</li><li>And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know"</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have talked about making sure to <strong>keep their love story out of the public eye</strong>.

And so it’s sort of a celebration of taking that very adult step of living with someone and deciding this is the path forward for you, walking alongside somebody else." Since she was dating Alwyn at the time, it's clear that she wrote "Lover" about him, and she must have written other songs on the album about him as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-teeth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Fixed Her Teeth, But Fans Are Worried Over Her Smile</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's smile might have been helped out with veneers, but there's another reason fans are concerned about her teeth.</span><p>While the singer might not explain exactly what she wrote the song about, Taylor Swift's "Cruel Summer" is very special to her.

She said that she wanted it to be a single when her "Lover" album was originally released, but it didn't work out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/was-taylor-swift-s-eras-merch-worth-it-despite-it-s-insane-price_.jpg><p>Swift said, “The weirdest, most magical thing is happening.
