There's no doubt that <a href=#>his ongoing feud with Meghan Markle</a> is his most famous. But the former Good Morning Britain host pretty much makes a living out of getting into feuds. That's because he almost always speaks his mind and it doesn't always resonate with everyone. In fact, it straight-up angers some people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>some on Reddit don't understand how he hasn't been canceled yet</a>, others defend his right to free speech but simply disagree with him. Either way, Piers knows precisely the type of energy he stirs up. After all, he's an exceptionally bright man and it would be hard not to notice all the hate. Because of the image that he's created even other celebrities have issues with him. And that includes a major comedian.</p><p><a href=#>Piers has had celebrity feuds with Nicki Minaj</a>, Daniel Craig, and even <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>. But there's one comedian who absolutely loathes him and told it right to his face. In fact, her interview with Piers is one of the most uncomfortable yet awesome moments in television history. We're, of course, talking about Chelsea Handler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-chelsea-handler-called-out-piers-morgan-right-to-his-face>Why Chelsea Handler Called Out Piers Morgan Right To His Face</h2><p>In 2011, Piers Morgan became the host of a CNN program that replaced Larry King's famous timeslot. The interview show received a lot of press, mostly due to how Piers conducted his interviews. Even though the show lasted for a few years, CNN decided to cancel in 2014. While some liked the way he did things, comedian Chelsea Handler was not one of those people. The brash and unyielding comic is also known for her celebrity feuds as, much like Piers, her image rubs some people the wrong way. And perhaps Piers was one of those individuals as he went into the interview insulting her and her work-ethic right off the bat. Because of this, Chelsea had no issue <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">calling out the host on his own show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I want viewers to know — I mean, they must know because they're probably following you on Twitter — I mean, you can't even pay attention for 60 seconds. You're a terrible interviewer," Chelsea said combatively.</p><p>"Well, you just weren't keeping my attention. That's more an issue for you than me," Piers snapped back.</p><p>"That's not my problem. This is your show. You have to pay attention to the guest that you invited on your show," Chelsea responded before saying that it doesn't matter how interesting Piers finds his guests, he has to do his job.</p><p>"Of course, it [matters if they're interesting]!"</p><p>"Well, maybe that's why your job is coming to an end."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chelsea Handler's Time On 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' Has Not Been Received Well, According To Instagram Comments</a></span></p><p>"Wow... Don't want to cross you, do we?"</p><p>"I dunno, do you?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chelsea and Piers' interaction has become one of the most notorious celebrity interviews around as it just kept going. It's the type of uncomfortable interview that some fans live for. Even though Piers tried to steer the interview back into the traditional realm, Chelsea just couldn't help but continue to insult him. While Piers managed to shoot a few insults over at her, it's clear that she had the advantage. She's the comedian, after all. But... she wasn't exactly joking... This is something many fans have picked up as the interview has been included in various compliations of people insulting Piers to his face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Piers Morgan’s Mothers’ Day Tribute Causes Backlash, Fans Say Meghan Also Is A Mother</a></span></p><h2 id=chelsea-handler-absolutely-hates-piers-morgan-to-this-day>Chelsea Handler Absolutely Hates Piers Morgan To This Day</h2><p>While a lot of comedians are mean for the sake of being funny, with time it seems that Chelsea's roast of Piers Morgan on his show was totally authentic. She doesn't like him and she wants the world to know. As recently as March 2021, when Piers got into his now-famous scandal surrounding his criticisms of <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, Chelsea <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweeted about how much she dislikes him</a>.</p><p>"Some a--hole's get better. Some just stay the same," Chelsea Tweeted alongside a clip of her 2014 interview with Piers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts to Piers Morgan Criticizing Megan Markle And Other Celebrity Mental Health Campaigners</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tweet received a ton of support from celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon, January Jones, Natalie Portman, and Dax Shepard. Of course, there were numerous celebrities who actually stood by Piers' right to criticize Meghan Markle, even if they didn't actually agree with the comments he made. While we don't know what Chelsea Handler's opinions are about Meghan Markle and Piers's right to criticize her, she was unequivocal about her true feelings about him. Due to the image that Piers has created for himself and the brutal honesty of her Tweet, over 10 thousand people re-tweeted Chelsea's comment in support. They clearly agreed with her.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is What Piers Morgan Has Been Up To Since Quitting 'Good Morning Britain'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinop2iqHquu9GgmKdlk52yrb%2FEmmShmZ6Zuaa%2BjLCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./7-revelations-from-breakfast-club-interview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>7 Revelations From 'Breakfast Club' Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sister-wives-kody-brown-wants-to-keep-hating-christine-in-season-18.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sister Wives' Kody Brown Wants to Keep 'Hating' Christine in Season 18</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
