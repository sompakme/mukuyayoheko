"He was a good guy, very nice," said the witness. "It was a busy day, but people weren't really looking at him." It was the last time he was photographed in public.</p><p>In the photos, Perry was seen wearing dark pants and a gray T-shirt, leaving with a beverage in hand alongside a friend who was carrying a takeout bag. The actor's last days have become a factor in identifying his cause of death. Hours leading up to the tragedy, he was reportedly experiencing "unusual fatigue" during a picketball match.</p><p>He was in an "upbeat mood" during the game despite feeling that way, days before his death. As its cause remains under investigation, the Friends cast has released a statement, saying: "We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just castmates. We are a family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There is so much to say, but right now we're going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.

"The fact that I would trade it all to not have this disease is true," he declared back then, noting that he's still grateful for his Friends popularity. "But I don't belittle how fun the experience has been on Friends. And the money was amazing. Just the creative experience of being on the show probably saved my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show even helped him curb his addiction, although he previously admitted that he was only sober during season 9. "When you're making a million dollars a week, you can't drink the 37th drink," he recalled. "You have to go home and go to sleep.… That was the greatest job in the world."</p><p>The interview was done in October 2022, a month before the release of his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. "I wanted to share when I was safe from going into the dark side of everything again," he said of writing his tell-all.</p><p>"I had to wait until I was pretty safely sober — and away from the active disease of alcoholism and addiction — to write it all down," he continued. "And the main thing was, I was pretty certain that it would help people."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-perry-took-a-serious-approach-to-his-final-interview-with-david-letterman.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Matthew Perry Took A Serious Approach To His Interview With David Letterman">Matthew Perry Took A Serious Approach To His Interview With David Letterman</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>David Letterman's Late Show interview took a turn after the host brought up Matthew Perry's recent rehab stint at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-feared-women-were-only-after-his-fame>Matthew Perry Feared Women Were Only After His Fame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar47842196.jpg><p>Perry also told People that he was finally ready to settle down after his long struggle with intimacy issues. "That was me afraid," he said of <a href=#>breaking up with his famous exes including Julia Roberts</a>. "That is what I manifest, something that's wrong with them. And then I break up with them."</p><p>He added: "But there can't be something wrong with everyone. I'm the common denominator. I left first because I thought they were going to annihilate me." He went on to say that he was "feeling more confident and I'm not afraid of love anymore, so the next girl I go out with better watch out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked what he was looking for in a partner, he emphasized that she should be "self-supporting. In every way, but monetarily especially because I got burned a few times by women who wanted my money, not really caring about me. A sense of humor, beautiful inside and out, caring. This is really important, somebody who can have a back and forth with me."</p><p>On October 30, 2023, a source confirmed to the Daily Mail that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 17 Again actor was "looking for love again</a>. But a string of failed relationships left him feeling sad and depressed, and as if he would never find that love he longed for. Matthew dated dozens of women. But in the end, he always felt they were only interested in his money and his fame. And he was generous to a fault."</p><p>The insider also revealed that "he would shower women with gifts only to have them pack up their goodies and walk away. In the end I think his years of fighting demons… Drugs and alcohol… Took a toll on him, and on his health, and eventually he would end up alone again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXZ60r7vRnptmmaRirm6u1KywZpyZo7KzecBmrp6dm2KvprLOq5xmoJmoeqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./usher-s-girlfriend-jenn-goicoechea-welcomes-2nd-child-his-4th.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ushers Girlfriend Jenn Goicoechea Welcomes 2nd Child, His 4th</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-wears-ben-affleck-s-flannel-shirt-while-traveling-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez Wears Ben Affleck's Flannel Shirt While Traveling: Pics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
