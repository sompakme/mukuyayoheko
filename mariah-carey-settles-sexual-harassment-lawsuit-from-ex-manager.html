Stopher reportedly managed Carey for three years, leaving her duties in November 2017. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>, is not revealed whether Stopher accepted a cash payoff from the “A No No” songbird.</p><p>According <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">to the suit</a>, Stopher claims that the Caution musician would often make her uncomfortable by walking around naked. She was seeking “unspecified damages” before the suit was dropped.</p><p>“Stella Bulochnikov was terminated from employment as Mariah’s manager due to failure to perform her job effectively and ill-serving her client,” wrote a representative for Carey in April 2018 in response to the lawsuit. “Stella was not under contract for employment. She has been spreading false rumors to any media outlet that will publish them. We won’t respond to lies and threats.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the dropped suit, Stopher also stated that she believed Carey had a substance abuse problem. Carey revealed her struggle with bipolar II disorder shortly before the lawsuit made headlines, saying she was worried that news of her diagnosis would leak.</p><p>It was too heavy a burden to carry and I simply couldn’t do that anymore,” she announced in 2018. I sought and received treatment, I put positive people around me and I got back to doing what I love — writing songs and making music.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Mariah Carey Reveals Struggle With Bipolar Disorder: “I Lived In Denial”</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kus7XAoWScmaKaxm6%2FxK2rpZ2jYsCmxNSao2agkaeutL%2FMnqWtZZyWxLTByK1kb2ppan9zew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./riley-carter-was-the-first-trans-man-to-play-trans-character-in-britain-here-is-more-on-him.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Riley Carter Was The First Trans Man To Play Trans Character In Britain, Here Is More On Him</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-the-lavish-life-of-true-thompson-daughter-of-khloe-kardashian.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside The Lavish Life Of True Thompson, Daughter Of Khloe Kardashian</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
