On the other hand, it's entirely possible he knew it would put the social media realm in hysterics, and he wanted to share a funny story with friends and fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the story had fans responding with everything from laughs to questions about the event, it also brought a renewed focus on the friendship that the pair share. Rogen and Rudd are two of the leading funny men in the entertainment industry and have a history of starring in some comedy greats together.</p><p>From Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy and Knocked Up to This Is The End and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the humor they have individually works well when the two share the big screen.</p><p>That same humor bonds them off-screen as well, and for as much as fans love their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">friendship</a>, their appreciation for one another is even better.</p><p>Here are some things fans enjoy about their friendship and the Tweet that made us all laugh hysterically.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Hilarious Movie Scenes That Were Completely Unscripted</a>&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=that-vegas-massage><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>That Vegas Massage</span></h2><p>When Seth Rogen tweeted the story of the massage <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Rudd</a> hijacked, fans loved it. The fact that Rudd immediately thought Rogen would notice but kept it going after he didn't was a comedic play in and of itself. While some fans said the experience was a little 'odd' -- many others responded that it alludes to their humor and friendship.</p><p>Plus, it's a staple of comedy; you stick to it until the curtains close!</p><h2 id=there-are-some-burning-questions><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>There Are Some&nbsp;Burning Questions</span></h2><p>In light of that massage story, fans and friends of the pair have a burning question. Was the massage a good one, or not?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeing as he didn't notice the change, we're assuming it was a good massage. That, or Rogen was too kind to say anything about a less-than-stellar massage from the mystery masseuse.</p><p>Either way, fans want a little more information about the massage! Here's hoping we get it.</p><h2 id=the-secret-to-eternal-youth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Secret To Eternal Youth</span></h2><p>One fan believes that the secret to eternal youth has finally been uncovered! It's not a lost fountain, it's not a potion you get from a visit with someone magical, and it's not something attainable by many. It's a full-body massage by none other than Paul Rudd himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Conan O'Brien And Seth Rogen Smoked Up Together And Fans Are Loving It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-sketch-was-born><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Sketch Was Born</span></h2><p>One fan took a moment to sketch the funny story shared by Rogen on Twitter, and it has to be one of the best things we've seen all week. We're truly hoping that this is something they talk about one day in an interview, or better yet, reference in a future project together.</p><h2 id=they-re-leading-funny-men><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They're Leading Funny Men</span></h2><p>The list of films they've worked on together is full of winning movies, but Knocked Up is a fan favorite. The characters they portray are done so well that it's evident they bring their own traits to the roles. It's also clear that their friendship off-screen shines through between Ben and Pete, especially in that infamous hotel chair scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you?"</p><p>"All the time man, like every day...I wonder how you like me."</p><p>The two shine in their own right, but as we can all say in our own lives, it's more fun when you can do what you love with those closest to you.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Paul Rudd And Jeffrey Dean Morgan?

In this episode of The<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Graham Norton Show</a>, Rudd talks about a time when he was trying to bond with Michael Douglas by paying homage to a classic film scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rogen can't stop laughing as Rudd explains the process of trying to set up for the joke and the fact that he didn't tell anyone else about it. There were a few, mishaps along the way, and Douglas ended up getting the wrong (at no fault of his own) idea about everything that was going on.</p><h2 id=they-love-to-give-each-other-a-hard-time><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Love To Give Each Other A Hard Time</span></h2><p>When Paul Rudd partnered with Omaze for charity, the prize was a day of mini-golf with him. As he explained this to fans, he invited some of his friends to describe just how important the experience is to him.&nbsp;One of those friends was Seth Rogen, and he had some special advice for whoever won the prize. He also shared a little bit about what it's like to play the sport with Rudd - spoiler alert, there are no breaks in Rudd's game!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-really-aren-t-sure-if-they-re-working-or-just-hanging-out><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Really Aren't Sure If They're Working Or Just Hanging Out</span></h2><p>In another interview, this time for Knocked Up, the pair agreed that most of the time it just feels like they're hanging out when they're making movies. Seth Rogen even said he's not sure how they turn what they do into films at all.</p><p>"It's shocking that they were able to make a movie out of it because we were really just hanging out. We're kind of idiots, as you can probably see, so when left to our own devices we'll do this -- which is not interesting. Through the magic of editing, this will seem hilarious."</p><p>The truth is, they're both dedicated to their roles, and their talent mixed with their humor is what makes fans line up to see films they star in together, again and again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Rudd Hasn't Aged A Day, Here Are His Secrets</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2cYr%2B2sMNmqp6smGK%2FsLPEp2Sfqpmau6W%2Fx6KnZpqipLqiusKeZKaZo6iuqLGMqamapptis6Kv06xm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justice-department-blames-emo-rap-for-opioid-crisis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justice Department Blames Emo Rap For Opioid Crisis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./get-to-know-the-cast-of-apple-tv-s-the-buccaneers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Get to Know the Cast of Apple TV+'s 'The Buccaneers'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
