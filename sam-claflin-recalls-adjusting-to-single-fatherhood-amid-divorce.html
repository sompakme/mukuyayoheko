They share two children, son Pip, 7, and <a href=#>Margot</a>, 5.</p><p>“Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another, whilst we continue to raise our family together,” Claflin<a href=#> wrote in a statement</a> via Instagram Story at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sam-clafin-laura-haddock.jpg><p>Now, more than three years later, the Me Before You star reflected on the early days as a divorcée and a single dad. He explained to Variety: “I think I needed to work out a few kinks in my own life, to figure out who I was as this dad on my own in a house outnumbered by two toddlers. Then this job coming out the back of that was just the most fun, joyous fresh start.”</p><p>Prime Video’s Daisy Jones & the Six follows a 1970s rock band’s rise to fame and sudden breakup. Claflin plays lead singer Billy, who marries his hometown sweetheart, Camila (<a href=#><strong>Camila Morrone</strong></a>), and welcomes a daughter amid his drug and alcohol addiction. As he tries to keep his substance abuse under control and his family together, he starts working with singer Daisy Jones (<a href=#><strong>Riley Keough</strong></a>). Their lighting-in-a-bottle chemistry could make his band the best — and make his marriage fall apart.</p><p>Claflin couldn’t relate to Billy’s struggles with drugs and alcohol, but he certainly knew what it was like to struggle as a spouse and parent. “I was a husband. I’ve been through marriage and the struggle of juggling work, family life, home and being grounded,” he said. “The obstacles he has to overcome, like becoming a dad and the fear or anxiety that brings, feeling like you might fail. … His fear of failure is something that I can massively relate to — needing to feel approval and the fear of abandonment. I’ve been through this struggle. And I’m sure the struggle will continue.”</p><p>However, he believes <a href=#>Daisy Jones & the Six </a>helped him get through the roughest part of his split. He was cast just a few months after he and Haddock confirmed their divorce, and the five-week prep for the drama turned into a year and a half amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think my relationship with myself is a lot better than it was,” Claflin said. “Before, I didn’t like who I was or what I had to say. Whereas now, after going through the journey of Billy Dunne, I realize how therapeutic or cathartic it was to tell a story that feels really authentic to me. It allowed me the opportunity to approach life differently.”</p><p>Prime Video’s Daisy Jones & the Six premieres Friday, March 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasmZ1isK2txaWgp2WimrCiuMusZJqcmqrAtbXNoGStp12otq%2Bzy55kn5mknbKztM6om2aZnZ6xbrDIr6arm5Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-reason-why-steve-o-made-jackass-the-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Real Reason Why Steve-O Made 'Jackass: The Movie'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./naguib-sawiris-net-worth-how-much-is-naguib-sawiris-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Naguib Sawiris Net Worth How Much is Naguib Sawiris Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
