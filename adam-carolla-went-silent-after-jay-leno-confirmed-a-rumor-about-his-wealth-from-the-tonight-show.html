And in fact, a lot of them shared their personal experiences with the late night host. Not a single negative experience was shared.</p><p>Fans wrote, "Lot of people in LA have a Jay story. Bumped into him once at the only gas station in Beverly Hills, he was filling up up an old banged up Indian motorcycle he was riding around on. I commented on his bike and he just chatted with me for 20 minutes like we were bros. Jay is good people."</p><p>"I was on a flight with Jay Leno - sat next to him for the entire flight. He was a "regular" guy on the plane. No one to meet him at the baggage claim - got his own luggage got on the same bus to the hotel with everyone else. All while doing the Tonight Show. Wore pretty much what he has on in this video.
