These heroes were portrayed by some pretty big A-list names, as Chloé Zhao’s star-studded cast included Anjelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, leading man Richard Madden and returning <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> star, Gemma Chan. As the film primarily centered around the relationships the heroes formed between each other and the human world, it's easy to see how those bonds would transcend the screen and form in between the actors. The <a href=#>cast themselves openly spoke out about this</a> multiple times as they highlighted the friendships that were built during the filming of the feature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About 'Eternals' Star Richard Madden's Relationship With Ellie Bamber</a></span></p><p>Amidst these friendships blossoming under the public eye, the attention turned towards the film’s soulmate pairing, Madden and Chan, and the nature of their real-life relationship off-screen. With Madden having been <a href=#>previously rumored to be dating his Cinderella love interest</a> and co-star Lilly James, the same thought began to circulate about his Eternals partner. So let’s take a look at the truth behind the relationship between the new heroes.</p><h2 id=they-rsquo-ve-been-friends-for-10-years><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They’ve Been Friends For 10 Years</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to Eternals, Madden and Chan had known each other for over 10 years, meaning their friendship had been flourishing for over a decade prior to them sharing the screen. During an interview with British Vogue, Chan highlighted how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her friendship with Madden had helped her in playing his soulmate</a> on screen in Eternals.</p><p>She stated, “Over a span of a thousand years, how do you play a normal relationship? The good thing is, Richard and I have known each other for over 10 years”</p><h2 id=madden-recommended-chan-for-her-role-as-sersi-in-39-eternals-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Madden Recommended Chan For Her Role As Sersi in 'Eternals'</span></h2><p>It seems as though <a href=#>Chan’s return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> may have had more to do with Madden than many may have realized. After previously starring beside the almighty Brie Larson, as Minerva in 2019's Captain Marvel, Chan was given the rare opportunity to return as Eternals’ leading lady, Sersi. According to Yahoo News, Zhao herself detailed the way in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madden’s recommendation for Chan as Sersi</a> resulted in her getting the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zhao stated, “Then Richard says, 'You should read my friend, Gemma Chan. We're really close.' So then we brought Gemma in to read with Richard but also by herself. Right away, we were like, 'Oh my God, that's our Sersi.' She just walked in and she was Sersi."</p><h2 id=their-long-term-friendship-helped-them-with-their-roles-in-39-eternals-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Their Long Term Friendship Helped Them With Their Roles In 'Eternals'</span></h2><p>For those who have seen Eternals, they are very much aware of a specific intimate moment between the film’s leading couple. As the first-ever sex scene in the MCU, many questions were raised towards Zhao, Madden, and Chan about what that had been like and what this meant for the future of Marvel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst speaking to The Independent, Chan opened up about what it had been like filming this moment. She highlighted how the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">friendship between herself and Madden had aided in the smooth running</a> of the scene due to the trust that they had built up throughout the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Gemma Chan's Beauty Secret Raises Eyebrows</a></span></p><h2 id=they-constantly-praise-each-other><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Constantly Praise Each Other</span></h2><p>To an outsider looking in, the established friendship between the pair would be something that would be clear to see by the way in which the pair talk about each other. This was particularly prevalent in a recent press interview with Get Into Film in which they were asked how they would describe the other and compare them to their Eternals character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to this, Madden stated, “You share a lot of characteristics that Sersi has. I mean you are an empath and very compassionate.”</p><p>Whilst Chan added that she thought Madden was “very loyal” with a “strong sense of responsibility.”</p><h2 id=but-they-rsquo-re-not-afraid-to-poke-fun-at-each-other><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>But They’re Not Afraid To Poke Fun At Each Other</span></h2><p>Despite the loving words of praise that Madden and Chan tend to speak about each other, the pair also often take things into a more comedic and playful banter. During several press interviews for Eternals, the pair have not been afraid to poke fun at the other.</p><p>For example, as the Get Into Film interview progressed, Chan jokingly made a few comments in which she had described Madden as “a little cocky.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-love-to-pose-for-a-quick-picture-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Love To Pose For A Quick Picture Together</span></h2><p>Littered across Chan’s Instagram account are heartwarming moments showcasing her and Madden’s friendship. Whether it be goofy Halloween posts or cute birthday tributes, it seems as though Chan and Madden are partial to a playful snap. The last picture that the Crazy Rich Asians alum posted beside her Eternals co-star was one of the pair at a surprise fan screening of the film alongside fellow Eternals alum, Lauren Ridloff.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 'Eternals' Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=and-love-to-share-a-quick-snuggle><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Love To Share A Quick Snuggle</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also seems as though the pair aren’t afraid to show their more affectionate side. Amongst these adorable pictures, are several of Madden and Chan in a warm embrace. The adorable snuggling pics seem to drive fans crazy as they witness the beautiful friendship. In one particular picture, a fan branded the pair “two pretty best friends.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Behind The Scenes Facts And Pics From Marvel's 'Eternals'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYlr%2Blecyam52dnmK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5zJysZpufYsC1rdFmnp6lnZZ6pLTAp2SerJWnu6K40mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-jumanji-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Which 'Jumanji' Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophia-bush-reveals-why-she-left-chicago-p-d.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sophia Bush Reveals Why She Left 'Chicago P.D.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
