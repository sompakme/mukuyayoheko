Even though critics had doubts about their castings then, fans of the books loved the actors in the movies. Almost seven years after the first film's release Dakota Johnson is finally sharing what it was like filming steamy scenes for the films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dakota Johnson's Interview With Ellen Took An Awkward Turn When The Actress Snubbed Ellen As Her Favorite Comedian.</a></span></p><p>During their time as lead actors in the Fifty Shades franchise, Johnson and Dornan were accused of not having enough onscreen chemistry to bring the characters to life. Also, rumors spread quickly during that time that they hated each other because of their awkward public appearances. However, that was far from the truth about their relationship on set.</p><p>"We were doing the weirdest things for years, and we needed to be a team: 'We're not doing that' or 'You can't do that camera angle.'" Dakota Johnson, who was only 23 years old when she began <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">playing Anastasia Steele admitted "it was scary</a>" and scenes like those in the Red Room were uncomfortable to film. However, Dornan did his best to improve the circumstances for her on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson revealed her co-star did a lot of studying beforehand to ensure she felt safe and protected. The Fall actor would be the first person to throw a blanket over her when they yelled 'Cut!'. "It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed, naked, in a scene. But then they call 'Cut' and you're still tied to the bed, naked."</p><h2 id=how-dakota-johnson-felt-about-jamie-dornan>How Dakota Johnson Felt About Jamie Dornan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/copy-of-untitled-18.jpg><p>Dakota Johnson<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> isn't entertaining the feud rumors</a> with her Fifty Shades of Grey co-star and is ensuring everyone knows it. The Persuasion actress told VanityFair there was no feud between them, and the stories were completely false. "There was never a time when we didn't get along. I know it's weird, but he's like a brother to me,"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson said as the franchise stars, she and Dornan had to trust and protect each other while filming. "I love him so, so, so much. And we were really there for each other." Moreover, when the first film's director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, left, they had to show a united front, especially regarding what explicit scenes they were willing to do on camera.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Jamie Dornan's Wife Really Feels About (50 Shades Of Grey) And Dakota Johnson</a></span></p><p>James Foley came on to direct the last two films and had a different creative vision than Taylor-Johnsnon. The directors, studios, and other influences on set made filming almost unbearable for Dakota Johnson.</p><h2 id=why-filming-fifty-shades-of-grey-was-so-chaotic>Why Filming Fifty Shades Of Grey Was So Chaotic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dakota-Johnson-And-Jamie-Dornan.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Dakota Johnson felt safe and protected while filming alongside Jamie Dornan, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">admitted later on things could get a bit psychotic on set</a>. She aired her frustrations about the book's writer E.L. James (Erika), having a lot of creative control "all day, every day" and often demanded which scenes from the erotic novels she wanted in the live-action films.</p><p>Johnson added that parts of the books just wouldn't work when placed in the film. "Like the inner monologue, which was, at times, incredibly cheesy. It wouldn't work to say it out loud. It was always a battle. Always." She said the script was so unappealing that she took matters into her own hands and rewrote some parts to make the film better for moviegoers.</p><p>"The night before, I would rewrite scenes with the old dialogue so I could add a line here or there. It was like mayhem all the time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The How To Be Single actress also revealed that this led to a lot of disagreements on set. "I haven't been able to talk about this truthfully ever because you want to promote a movie the right way, and I'm proud of what we made ultimately, and everything turns out the way it's supposed to, but it was tricky." To get around Erika's control on set, she and some of the cast had to do several takes for one scene.</p><p>The 33-year-old added, "They did takes from the film that Erika wanted to make and takes from the film they wanted to make." Johnson said she could have revealed more about the psychotic energy on set but didn't want to "damage anyone's reputation." Dakota also added if she had known how chaotic Erika would have made things on set, she wouldn't have been so open to being part of it. "If I had known at the time that's what it was going to be like, I don't think anyone would've done it. It would have been like, 'Oh, this is psychotic."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Dakota is opening up about her struggles while filming the Fifty Shades films, she maintains Erika is a nice woman who was always kind to her. To add, she doesn't regret being in the films that made her a household name in just a few years. "I'm glad she wanted me to be in those movies."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidop6krnq0tMCdnKxln5t6qL7EsmSjmZ2esm6wzqulmqZdma6su9OaZKOnmKPAsLqMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZpmnoMSivsNmoKeslafDqrHWrGSeZZxit6K5xKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gavin-casalegno-wiki-height-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gavin Casalegno Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brooklyn-beckham-is-dating-madison-beer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brooklyn Beckham Is Dating Madison Beer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
