We do sleep in the same bed [with our dog] Hippie every night,” Ally, 28, exclusively told Us Weekly on Tuesday, April 23, the same day the episode aired where it was revealed they were sleeping in separate rooms because of their pets. “We have our little routine. It’s my favorite part of the day.”</p><p>Fans watched earlier this season when James, 32, <a href=#>reunited with the dog</a> he previously coparented with ex <strong>Rachel “Raquel” Leviss</strong>. James subsequently renamed the pooch Hippie.</p><p>While Ally, <a href=#>who has two cats</a>, initially had some concerns about taking ownership of the pet, she’s now all-in on the dog. “I feel completely different,” Ally said. “He’s my baby and I love him so much and I’m obsessed with him.”</p><p>Ally and James even “cuddle” with Hippie and their cat Banks in bed. “Hippie now sleeps where Banks used to sleep,” Ally explained to Us. “And at that time during filming, I was really upset because it was hard for me. I felt bad for my cats. They were kind of getting the short end of the stick there, but now Banks and Hippie are friends, thank god.”</p><p>Ally noted that the couple’s cat Bodhi, on the other hand, is “still a little shy” about adding another furry friend into the mix. “Bodhi follows Banks’ lead with everything, so I’m not worried,” Ally said. “I’m really happy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/VPRs-Ally-Lewber-Reveals-Whether-She-and-James-Kennedy-Still-Sleep-in-Separate-Rooms.jpg><p>While Ally and James’ relationship seems to be in a good place now, viewers watched as they struggled with Hippie’s arrangements as they planned to travel for her friend’s wedding.</p><p>In the episode, VPR costar <strong>Lala Kent</strong> commented that James came “first” in their relationship — which Ally agreed “felt a little bit like that” at the time.</p><p>“I was kind of glad she said it at that time,” Ally recalled of Lala’s remark. “I was like, ‘Wait, yeah, I’ve made some compromises.’ And all I was asking was for him to come to the wedding. So at that time, for sure, I get it. But again, I also understood where he was coming from.”</p><p>Ally added that she and James, who’ve <a href=#>been dating since January 2022</a>, are “pretty good” at being there for one another. “I mean, he just helps support me with the music and doing that and being in the music video,” she said. “So I do think we support each other equally.”</p><p>As for whether wedding bells and baby bottles are in the pair’s future, Ally shared that she and James are “on the same page” — but potentially different timelines.</p><p>“He wants kids. I definitely know he wants marriage,” Ally said. “I’m not in a huge rush where I think he just takes everything. He’s quick, he’s quick moving, and I’m a little more slow paced. When it happens, it happens, but he is understanding.”</p><p>Ally added that she’s “so happy,” citing her career in Astrology, and noted that James is “so busy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m also like, where would we have the time? That’s just not the chapter we’re in, I think right now,” she said. “So we have had more conversations about it and we are on the same page.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET and is available to stream on Peacock the next day.</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Hearon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavqKKoeqK4y7JkqKZdnrNuv8eeZJqmlGK3ornErGSknZ6jsqXFjKyroqScYsCtscSpZKKmXaiysa3RmqueZZKasbR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-dermot-mulroney-after-friends.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Dermot Mulroney After Friends?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./unlock-earnings-how-much-money-can-you-make-on-feet-finder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Unlock Earnings: How Much Money Can You Make on Feet Finder?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
