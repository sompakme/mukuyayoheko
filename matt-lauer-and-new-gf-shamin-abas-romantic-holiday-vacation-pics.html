The former couple, who wed in 1998, called it quits in November 2017 after Lauer was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. As a result of the allegations, which he denied, NBC cut ties with the host.</p><p>“She knows who he is,” the insider told In Touch about Abas. “She’s thrilled she’s with him. She doesn’t seem to have a care in the world.”</p><p>Lauer broke his silence on the allegations against him in a lengthy statement in April 2018.</p><p>“I have made no public comments on the many false stories from anonymous or biased sources that have been reported about me over these past several months. I remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost,” he said. “But defending my family now requires me to speak up. I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.”</p><p>In October, however, new accusations against Lauer surfaced after his NBC News colleague <a href=#><strong>Brooke Nevils</strong> alleged that he raped her in a hotel room</a> while they were covering the 2014 Sochi Olympics in Russia. While Lauer admitted to cheating on Roque with Nevils, he claimed their relationship was consensual.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lauer and Roque share sons Jack, 18, and Thijs, 13, and daughter Romy, 16. <strong>Hilary Gumbel,</strong> a close friend of Lauer, told <a href=#>Us in December that the family is doing better in recent months.</a></p><p>“My husband [<strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong>] is a very loyal friend, which is lovely, and he’s doing as best as he can. We get together every now and then,” Gumbel told Us. “The kids are doing much better, which means a lot.”</p><p>Scroll through to see the pictures of Lauer and Abas’ getaway:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqLA02ajmq2Vp3qiusNmpZ6vXZyzbr%2FHmqSipl2Wr6K%2FjKumppmeqbakeceoo6Kcka56t63Cmquip55ivaqv0mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-nfl-s-biggest-salaries-ranking-the-kansas-city-chiefs-richest-players-right-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The NFL's Biggest Salaries: Ranking The Kansas City Chiefs' Richest Players Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./journalist-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Journalist Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
