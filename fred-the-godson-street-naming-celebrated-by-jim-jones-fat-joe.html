Among the dozens of those that showed love to the rapper that passed away in April 2020 due to COVID-19 were BX native <a href=# id=auto-tag_fat-joe data-tag=fat-joe>Fat Joe</a> and Harlem repper <a href=# id=auto-tag_jim-jones data-tag=jim-jones>Jim Jones</a>. The street’s South Bronx location of Leggett avenue and Kelly street will now also be called Fredrick “Fred The Godson” Thomas Way.</p><p>While snow fell heavily, the crowd of supporters and the organizers stood strong and watched as the sign was unveiled to cheers of joy. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Fred The Godson Foundation</a> worked hard to make this day happen on what would have been Fred’s 36th birthday. “Shortly after Fred’s passing, the Fred The Godson Foundation was created to carry on his legacy for his children and family, and the commitment to his dreams for the Bronx,” says the foundation’s mission statement. “The mission is to inspire, empower and nourish individuals, children and families in underserved communities, starting with Fred’s birthplace. The foundation will foster community unity through the common pursuit of wellness, prosperity, and opportunity.”</p><p>Known for having one of the most celebrated flows that included a barrage of double entendres and metaphors that were rarely matched, Fred was a respected MC with enormous skills that were able to get him featured on the famed 2011 XXL ‘Freshman’ class magazine cover along with Meek Mill, Mac Miller (RIP) and Kendrick Lamar. Jim Jones had some heartfelt words for the one named ‘Gordo’ at the ceremony, “Fred inspired me to do this music, a lot all over again. There was a time I really didn’t want to do no music…and Fred would say, ‘Nah, you gotta get in that booth Capo.'”</p><p><br>The Thomas family announced thank you’s and love to Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. of District 17 in the South Bronx, Bronx Borough President Ruban Diaz, NYPD’s 41st Precinct, and the Bronx community for helping make the Frederick “Fred the Godson” Thomas Way street co-naming possible.</p><p><br>Much respect to the legacy of the husband and father, Fred The Godson.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5uutXnJqJxmopmiequ7zZ6qZpuVobKjvsCtnGaeopqxbsDHnmSgp5SovK95lXFuam9kZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-nle-choppa-black-or-white.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is NLE Choppa Black Or White?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dee-rasedile-biography-age-career-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dee Rasedile Biography, Age, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
