The two once seemed so in love, which made their very intense divorce proceedings surprising. The former couple are parents to six kids who are all in their teen years. Vivienne Marcheline Jolie-Pitt and Knox Léon Jolie-Pitt are both 14 years old. Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt is 17, Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt is 18, and Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt is 19.

This is why Angelina Jolie's comments about his parenting have been shocking to hear about. Does Brad Pitt see his daughter Vivienne Jolie Pitt regularly?</p><p>There are conflicting reports about Brad Pitt and Vivienne's relationship, which suggests that this is a very complicated situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brad-pitt.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told Us Weekly in August 2022 that the actor was a staple in his kids' lives and that they did see each other a lot. The source explained, “He thinks the world of all of his children and loves having them over at his place in L.A., where they enjoy long meals together, take walks around the estate and sometimes drive up the coast where they’ll enjoy hikes on the beach."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Brad Pitt Movie Was One Of His Worst Box Office Earners, But Critics Say It's Perfect</a></span></p><p>But just a few months later, in October 2022, a source told Page Six that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt had a "limited" and "strained" connection</a> to his children.</p><p>It's possible that Brad Pitt does see Vivienne Jolie-Pitt as often as he can. But even though Pitt and Jolie are so famous, they make sure that their kids have regular childhoods and that strangers don't see them that often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As reported by Page Six in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolie and Pitt have joint custody of their children</a>.

Brad was just trying to have more time with his kids — and it has been clear that Angie has done everything possible to prevent this.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Do Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt Think About Shiloh's Dating Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Brad Pitt wanted to be able to see his children, including Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, as much as Angelina Jolie does, it seems likely that he and Vivienne still have a nice relationship. It's never easy for kids to watch their parents argue and go through a divorce. But Pitt seems committed to staying in Vivienne's life. Jolie and her kids are always all smiles when they're photographed together. It seems safe to say that the kids are doing well despite the tough times they have been through.</p><h2 id=what-did-brad-pitt-say-about-his-relationship-with-his-daughter-vivienne-jolie-pitt>What Did Brad Pitt Say About His Relationship With His Daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt?</h2><p>Brad Pitt has been fairly quiet about his relationships with his six children since splitting from Angelina Jolie. While he has talked about being sober in several interviews, he hasn't gone into details about his kids. And he hasn't said anything about his current relationship with Vivienne Jolie-Pitt.</p><p>In the past, however, Brad Pitt has talked about being a good parent. He explained to Details Magazine "I've discovered I don't suck at being a dad" in 2014. And when Jolie and Pitt welcomed twins Knox and Vivienne in 2008, Brad Pitt was ready for the adventure of having six children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angelina-jolie-kids-1.jpg><p>As the actor explained to The Telegraph, "It’s chaos at times, but there’s such joy in the house." He also said, “We were four [children] before, and we got into our rhythms and it worked. Then someone new comes in, and it discombobulates the movements for a moment, but then you settle in again and it just all works. Everyone’s pretty well integrated. It’s not the first time new kids have come in.”</p><p>In 2014, Pitt was interviewed by Psychologies Magazine and said something very moving about being a dad. And it seems that he must still believe this. The actor explained, “I care about them more than I care about myself. You see past yourself and become more generous and giving, and wanting only the best for your family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Brad Pitt Banned Himself From Ever Getting An Instagram Account</a></span></p><p>Pitt also told Psychologies, “I worry about them all the time. That’s the emotional bond and responsibility that sweeps over you when you have a family to look after.”</p><p>After hearing Pitt's perspective on parenting, it makes sense that he wanted joint custody of his kids. And it makes sense that he battled Jolie for five years to make this happen.</p><p>It's unclear how many days a week or month Brad Pitt is able to hang out with Vivienne and his other children. But he might not want to tell anyone these details. According to E! News, a source said, "He spends low-key time with his kids at home. He keeps their time together private. They are homebodies and have a good routine in place."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/zahara-vivienne-jolie-pitt.jpg><p>While Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's kids are still pretty young, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt proved that she has her parents' acting talent when she played a child version of Aurora in the Maleficent movie.</p><p>According to ABC News, Jolie and Vivienne read lines and Jolie was amazed by her daughters' talent. The actress explained that if her children want to be actors, they should do it because they enjoy it, not because they feel there's a source of obligation. It seems that Pitt was supportive of this movie role as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYq%2BzrcNmp6KspGLAprGMnZiun5ipsrN51aKtop2eo7Juts6loJ5loJ7BtXnFq5icrKWnsqV50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZJqepJq%2FbrDIr6arm5Vis7O7zGaYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./imani-hakim-net-worth-how-much-is-hakim-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Imani Hakim Net Worth How Much is Hakim Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dave-bautista-is-set-to-star-in-afterburn-with-samuel-l-jackson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dave Bautista Is Set To Star In Afterburn With Samuel L.
