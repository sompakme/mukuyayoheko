Rocky spawned six sequels, each a box office success, and cemented Stallone's action-hero image.</p><p>But he wasn't a one-man show.

He wrote the screenplay three days after watching the Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner fight in 1975:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stallone initially had to fight to take the lead role.

Factoring in backend percentages and ten net points, MGM's total payment to Stallone for Rocky amounts to around $2.5 million.</p><p>While he missed out on Rocky's lucrative merchandising rights, this underdog tale became his launchpad. With each Rocky sequel, Stallone's star power and paychecks grew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rocky II brought Stallone a $75,000 payday, and the third installment, Rocky III, doubled it to $120,000. He was paid $15 million by Rocky V and later returned to the franchise for Creed I and Creed II with $10 million base salaries each.</p><p>However, Rocky wasn't his only cash cow. His Rambo franchise also proved lucrative, with Stallone earning $3.5 million for First Blood and $16 million for Rambo III.</p><p>Beyond his signature franchises, Stallone consistently negotiated impressive paychecks. In 1983, the Rambo actor earned $10 million (equivalent to $25 million adjusted for inflation) for his debut as a producer with Staying Alive.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mike-tyson-net-worth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Mike Tyson's Net Worth: From Boxing To Hotboxing</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After falling from a $400 million peak to bankruptcy, Mike Tyson's net worth is suddenly very green.</span><p>In 1984, he earned $4 million and a producer credit for Rhinestone.
