The singer brought her parents, <strong>Andrea</strong> and<strong> Scott Swift</strong>, along for the festivities. The trio entered Arrowhead Stadium alongside a Santa Claus carrying a bag of gifts and ringing a Christmas bell.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>All three Swifts were dressed in holiday gear for the day out, with the Grammy-winner donning a plaid skirt, black stockings and a red shirt in support of the Chiefs. She wore her blonde locks pinned halfway up in a black bow and rocked her signature red lip. Andrea and Scott, for their part, sported Christmas-themed hats in celebration of the holiday.</p><p>Kelce previously teased his Christmas plans earlier this month. Despite having to work, he told <a href=#>People</a>, “It will be a fun one.”</p><p>As for how his family would be spending the holiday, Kelce revealed that his brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>, “sent me a text and said he’s going to be celebrating afterwards” since his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, has a home game against the New York Giants on Monday. Travis confirmed that he would follow his sibling’s lead by enjoying the Christmas festivities after his game or the following day.</p><p>Swift, meanwhile, has become a regular attendee of Travis’ games since <a href=#>making her first appearance</a> at Arrowhead Stadium in September. She most recently made headlines when <a href=#>his team played the New England Patriots</a> in Massachusetts on December 17.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Taylor-Swift-Spends-Christmas-at-Travis-Kelce-Chiefs-Raiders-Game-2.jpg><p>After Swift received some boos — along with a lot of love — from the crowd at Gillette Stadium, Travis addressed the incident during the Wednesday, December 20, episode of his and Jason’s “New Heights” podcast.</p><p>“I’ll say this, they showed Taylor at the game and you don’t see an entire home team fanbase go insane for somebody wearing the opposite team’s colors,” Travis said. “Just shows you how amazing that girl is.”</p><p>Travis went on to downplay the negative reactions to Swift’s attendance. “They went absolutely insane when they showed Taylor on the screen. … Might have been a few <a href=#>Brads and Chads that were booing</a>, but for the most part, everybody was f—king screaming at Taylor,” he noted. “I was trying to keep it cool, I was like, ‘Don’t show your cards.’”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Santa arrived with a very special guest. ❤️🎅 <a href=#>@taylorswift13</a> | <a href=#>@Chiefs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OAjB7jDPZt</a></p><p>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>December 25, 2023</a></p><p>Swift, who was <a href=#>accompanied by her father, <strong>Scott Swift</strong>,</a> at the December 17 game, has been largely welcomed by the NFL fandom. As for the few naysayers, she has tuned out their opinions.</p><p>“I don’t know how they know what suite I’m in. … I’m <a href=#>just there to support Travis</a>,” she explained in her Time cover story earlier this month. “I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads and Chads.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Taylor clarified the <a href=#>timeline of her romance with Travis</a>, divulging that they “started hanging out right after” he <a href=#>“very adorably” called her out</a> on his podcast in July.</p><p>“We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,” she shared. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdqL2musOsZJygop7AtbnArGSarF2pv6LCyKxkpJ2cmLK0ecKhoJ6eo2K%2ForXDnqmsZZeWuqZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-jim-parsons-really-thinks-of-young-sheldon-s-iain-armitage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Jim Parsons Really Thinks Of Young Sheldon's Iain Armitage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-hawkins-boyfriend-relationship-timeline-with-tom-clare.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Hawkins Boyfriend: Relationship Timeline With Tom Clare</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
