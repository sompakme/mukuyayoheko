This horror hostess is a well-known figure in pop culture. She recently uploaded a video that leaves fans stunned as she appears to be a timeless campaigner for her favorite holiday.</p><p>You can see her latest video below and learn about Elvira, Mistresse of the Dark’s age and net worth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=elvira-mistress-of-the-darks-new-video></span>Elvira, Mistress of the Dark’s new video<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Queen of Halloween, Oct. 13, 2020, debuted the “Don’t Cancel Halloween” video on her Elvira Mistress of Dark YouTube channel.</p><p>This song parodies Madonna’s 1983 hit “Holiday”. The lyrics are: I’m the Queen Halloween/COVID-19 has ruined everything/ If they cancel Halloween/cause we’re still in quarantine/ That would make me mad/It wouldn’t suck/ It’d suck so badly.</p><p>Since then, the video has gone viral. People are shocked that the Mistress Of The Dark doesn’t appear to have aged in any way since her debut in the early 1980s. Many were left wondering how old she is now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=elvira-aka-cassandra-petersons-age></span>Elvira aka Cassandra Peterson’s age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elvira Peterson is actually Cassandra Peterson. She was born in Manhattan on Sept. 17, 1951. How does she look so young?</p><p>The TV horror host shared her beauty tips with ELLE, including “wash your face before you go to bed” and “embrace your dark (gothic) side all year.”</p><p>“Get a wig that looks just like your real hair” and RuPaul is the best person to talk to about the best skin products. Elvira is also immortal so that’s another plus.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=elvira-net-worth></span>Elvira Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>KHJ-TV in Los Angeles was seeking to revive a weekly horror program called Fright night, which had been hosted by Sinister Seymour (later Larry Vincent) in 1981. Peterson auditioned for the horror host role and Elvira, her alter ego, was born. She was quickly a celebrity synonymous with Halloween.</p><p>Peterson was a drag queen at a bar before her TV appearance. She stated via San Francisco Bay Guardian, “I always tell people that I was raised by a pack wild drag queens.” “I was surrounded by so many drag queens when I was young… Mr. Bobby and Tawny had me dress up… and then we’d do The Supremes.”</p><p>Peterson was also a Las Vegas showgirl, before she appeared on our TV screens in a black, cleavage-bearing gown with dark wig and a sarcastic sense humor.</p><p>Peterson, who is known as Elvira has hosted many horror and Halloween shows. She’s been featured in comic books and video games, too. She has appeared in several films, including Scooby-Doo Return to Zombie Island. Peterson has more than 80 credits as an actor in and outside of her iconic role. Peterson published a book entitled Elvira 35th Anniversary “coffin table”, in 2016.</p><p>She is estimated to have a net worth of $3.5 million today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqwuMNmoKxllaHDqr7AZqSiq6SnsrS%2FjKidZqyYmnqlrdGkZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-the-kardashian-jenners-bond-with-grandma-mary-jo-mj-shannon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside the Kardashian-Jenners' Bond With Grandma Mary Jo 'MJ' Shannon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blac-chyna-denies-lying-about-harvard-enrollment-watch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blac Chyna Denies Lying About Harvard Enrollment: Watch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
