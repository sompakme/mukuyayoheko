Although Vanessa Bryant tried to reconcile with her mom, things went too far and the dilemma went public.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at Sofia's claims and the sum she was asking for in return. According to Vanessa, it was a way for her mother to extort the family. The court case was eventually settled, but it doesn't appear as though the relationship between both sides was a salvageable one.</p><h2 id=sofia-urbieta-laine-39-s-lawsuit-mentioned-that-she-was-promised-a-pay-by-kobe-bryant>Sofia Urbieta Laine's Lawsuit Mentioned That She Was Promised A Pay By Kobe Bryant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50318145.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if dealing with her husband's passing wasn't hard enough, along with her daughter - Vanessa Bryant was faced with another situation that involved her mother.
