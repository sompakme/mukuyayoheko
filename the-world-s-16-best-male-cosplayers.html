Traditionally, massive conventions like Comic Con (and nerd culture in general) was &nbsp;largely a man’s world. It might seem like a sexist stereotype, but at one time, a girl may not have been found within one hundred miles of a comic book store or a showing of the latest Star Wars movie. Nerd culture has become much more inclusive since then, as women embrace their inner artist and reign supreme among some of the best cosplayers and most popular 'Con attendees in the world.</p><p>Now, as men put their artistic and creative abilities to the test by making exact replicas of Boba Fett, Scorpion, and Prince of Persia costumes, cosplay women have some worthy competition. Best of all, many of these men are collaborating with their fellow female Cosplayers to create some of the most realistic costumes and scenes in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=16-roland-s-forge><strong>16.

He’s a graduate of UNCG’s sculpture department and originally got into Cosplay to strengthen his portfolio for a future job in prop making. Although Cosplay may not be more than a hobby for Roland’s Forge, he has created incredibly realistic costumes like the villainous Jafar from Disney’s Aladdin. His version of Jafar was recognized by the popular Cosplay America fan page on Facebook when they spotted him at Anime Los Angeles earlier this month. A big part of a convincing costume is having the right model, and Roland’s Forge easily pulls off Jafar&nbsp;with his tall and slender figure.</p><h2 id=15-xailas><b>15.
