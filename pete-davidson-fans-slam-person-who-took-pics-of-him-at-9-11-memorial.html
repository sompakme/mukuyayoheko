Davidson's fans, in fact, slammed taking pictures of the comedian in such a delicate circumstance.</p><p>"Not sure what’s worse, the girl for taking the picture of him and sent this in or those who went up to him and asked him for a picture. Incredibly disrespectful," one person wrote.</p><p>"This is so gross to me," was another comment.</p><p>"Of all times NOT to take a sneaky pic of a celebrity, this should be it. He's there to honor his father and be comforted and comfort those who also lost a loved one.
