There is so much buzz about the album that there are rumors swirling that Rodrigo may just take center stage with Grammy nominations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bumping Taylor Swift and 'Midnights' to take the win when nominated in the same categories</a>.</p><p>Rodrigo is also going on tour in 2024. All concert dates are completely sold out, which means that her current net worth will be substantially higher by the time the tour concludes.</p><p>As if that were not enough going on for Rodrigo, she has also partnered with Sony to create limited edition earbuds that are anticipated to sell out shortly after they hit the shelves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-rodrigo-39-s-net-worth-is-16-million-in-2023><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Olivia Rodrigo's Net Worth Is $16 Million In 2023</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/olivia-rodrigo-2023.jpg><p>After breaking out on the scene on Disney and releasing her debut album, Sour back in May 2021, it's no surprise that Rodrigo has gone on to do quite well for herself. How well? The star is now worth a whopping $16 million, up from $5 million just two years ago. This is quite an impressive feat for someone who has been in the entertainment business for less than a decade.
