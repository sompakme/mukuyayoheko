The Swedish-born actress has appeared in a handful of successful films, including the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Netflix</strong></a> hit, 'The Sleepover', 'A Piece Of My Heart', and of course, the stars' most recent project, 'The Chick Fight', in which Akerman appears alongside big names such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Thorne</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alec Baldwin</a>, to name a few. Although she has had a great amount of on-screen, so has her husband, Jack Donnelly!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Malin is front and center, many fans of the star don't know much about Donnelly or his acting background. Akerman keeps her life quite private, including her marriage, which is exactly why not too many know much about either Malin or Jack! So, who exactly is Jack Donnelly? And have you seen him in anything before? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>New Netflix Series 'Bridgerton' With Julie Andrews Turns Heads With New Take On Victorian London</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-malin-akerman-s-hubby-jack-donnelly>Who Is Malin Akerman's Hubby, Jack Donnelly?</h2><p>Malin Akerman has on the rise within Hollywood! The actress is not only finding herself more and more in the spotlight, but she has been a part of countless successful films this year, including her hit 'The Sleepover', and 'Friendsgiving', which Malin appeared in alongside Kat Dennings, Aisha Tyler, Chelsea Perretti, and Wanda Sykes, to name a few. Although we know much about Malin and her journey to the big screen, it's her marriage to hubby, Jack Donnelly, that many fans do not know much about!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Akerman's nuptials to Donnelly marked the actress's second marriage, it was the first for Jack. Much like Malin, Jack Donnelly is also an actor and a rather successful one at that. Although he isn't on the same level as Brad Pitt and George Clooney, the star has appeared in a number of television series in both the United Kingdom and the United States, such as 'House of Anubis', 'Atlantis', and 'A Royal Winter'. Luckily for both Malin and Jack, it was their love for the arts that brought them together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix Releases BTS Pictures From Set Of 'Elite' Season Four</a></span></p><p>According to Vogue, the two had initially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met through Malin Akerman's younger sister. </a>She had introduced Malin to Jack and the duo instantly hit it off. They remained as friends for nearly 2 years before becoming romantically involved, it's clear it was worth the wait! Malin revealed that the first time Jack made a move was back in New York City. The actor surprised Akerman at her apartment with a bouquet of flowers and headed over to Malin's favorite Brooklyn spot, making it obvious that Jack had done his homework!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donelly now plays a major role in Malin's life as not only her husband but the step-father to her son from her first marriage with Robert Zincone. This not only proved Jack's love for Malin but his devotion to the two's marriage and family, as well. The trio has such a great dynamic that Malin's son, Sebastian, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even sang at her and Jack's wedding!&nbsp;</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Thanksgiving Movie 'Friendsgiving' Is The Dysfunctional Celebration Of The Year</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucCloKdlkaCys7nAp6pmoKWor6K6w2aYp5xdrLWiwIydpp6rXZ2ybrDOaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adamari-l%C3%B3pez-ex-husband-luis-fonsi-net-worth-height-age-parents-twitter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adamari Lpez Ex-Husband: Luis Fonsi Net Worth, Height, Age, Parents, Twitter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./misa-hylton-brim-wiki-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Misa Hylton Brim Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
