The how’s of it, the whens the whys? I don’t know.”</p><p>Jenn noted that “everyone is thinking about all the possibilities,” joking that “it’s become like a hobby.” She added, “I think anything is possible at this point.”</p><p>In her eyes, it’s not sustainable for the group to move forward with all the ongoing feuds. “Not like this certainly,” Jenn said. “There’s no more fun. I felt so good last season about being in it and being funny and being silly and goofy and a mess, and there’s just not that much of it at least so far this season.”</p><p>When asked whether filming the season 14 finale felt “final,” she replied, “Let’s hope so.” She added: “I mean, final in a way that the finale’s over, I would never want to relive that again.”</p><p>Multiple sources confirmed to Us&nbsp;on Monday, June 3, that the RHONJ season 14 will not be a traditional reunion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RHONJs-Jenn-Fessler-Responds-to-Season-14-Reunion-Rumors.jpg><p>“The reunion is supposed to be about resolution and it’s clear there’s no resolving any issues between the women,” an insider said. “There is no wrap-up in a bow and it’s not going to happen.”</p><p>The season 14 finale is set to be “finale of a lot of relationships,” as Jenn’s fellow RHONJ star <strong>Dolores Catania</strong> teased to Us<a href=#>&nbsp;exclusively last month</a>. The current season’s premiere had <a href=#>an explosive cold open</a> — with insults like “f–king lying c–t” flying — that previewed the fight taking place at Rails Steakhouse.</p><p>“It’s definitely closure for people, and you can’t come back from the stuff that you’re going to see at the finale. No coming back,” Dolores said. “I tried so hard to not get it to the point that it’s at, but because it got to this point, you have to say, ‘It’s so bad that it’s time to let things go.’”</p><p>After the RHONJ season 13 reunion aired last year, the cast was divided, with some showing loyalty to <strong>Teresa Giudice</strong> and others siding with <strong>Melissa Gorga</strong>. Dolores went on to tell Us that “if there was a shadow of a doubt” about any of the women making amends, “that’s gone” following the Rails fight.</p><p>Teresa and Melissa’s longtime family feud has come to a head, especially as season 14 continues and the sisters-in-law refuse to film together.</p><p>“I really don’t want to answer any questions about Teresa this year,” Melissa admitted during her confessional <a href=#>in the season 14 premiere</a>, which aired on May 5. Jenn has since found herself in the middle of the <a href=#>Giudice-Gorga feud</a> while proving her loyalty to Teresa.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Teresa is a good person,” Jenn said <a href=#>during the May 12</a> RHONJ episode. “You can’t stop staring at Teresa because … you never know what’s coming. Yeah, I enjoy her. Maybe that makes me disloyal, but I can’t help it.”</p><p>It’s unclear where the rest of the RHONJ women stand as season 14 has yet to come to an end — but there’s always drama in Jersey.</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey season 14 airs new episodes on Bravo Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGepl2bsrS%2Fy56pZqiclsa0ecKosGaZkqTCtXnRoaanol2nsra6yKilZquRrsBuwMeipaCrXZa%2FpnnCoZinn5mjtHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stanley-clarke-net-worth-age-height-weight-family-wiki-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stanley Clarke Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jacksonville-jaguars-trevor-lawrence-talks-marissa-mowry-marriage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jacksonville Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence Talks Marissa Mowry Marriage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
