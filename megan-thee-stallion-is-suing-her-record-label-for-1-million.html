It appears she’s trying to end their professional relationship; Megan’s attorneys state her last two albums (Something for Thee Hotties and Trauamazine) fulfill the stipulations of her contract.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jewelry Thief Doesn’t Regret Robbing Kim Kardashian In Paris</a></span></p><p>The official complaint states that Megan and her record label have a “long and tortured history of disputes […] including the unconscionability of the agreement in its original form.”</p><p>The complaint said they’ve been “able to resolve some of the disputes through the issuance of multiple temporary restraining orders against Defendants from this Court." However, it adds that a “new dispute has arisen requiring further assistance from the Court."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The details of Megan’s dispute with 1505 Certified Entertainment are not clear. However, the complaint reveals her label record <a href=#>argued Something for Thee Hotties doesn’t qualify as a full album</a>, and so they won’t release her from her contract yet. The label reportedly only told her this after the album was released.</p><p>The complaint claims the record label is trying to “take further advantage” of Megan “at great expense and in bad faith.”</p><p>So far, Megan’s legal team hasn’t publicly commented on the new filing. However, 1505 Certified Entertainment’s lawyers have issued a public statement. They don’t deny that they had a problem with Megan’s second last album, stating it features spoken word archival content and was released too soon <a href=#>following her debut album </a>Good News, which released in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Our belief is she owes us one more album, at least,” they lawyer, Steven M. Zager, stated.</p><p>The record label says it’s still evaluating whether Traumazine meets their criteria of a full album.</p><p>Shortly after Good News released, Megan filed a lawsuit against her record label in March 2020. At the time, she says their relationship took a turn for the worse after she tried to renegotiate her contract. She claims the label then allegedly prevented her from releasing new music.</p><p>“When I signed, I didn’t really know what was in my contract. I was young. I was like 20,” Megan said at the time. “It’s really just a greedy game.” At the time, she said she didn’t want to leave the record label, but simply wanted to renegotiate her contract for future releases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The court eventually <a href=#>granted her a temporary restraining order</a>, which allowed her to drop new music. The following year, she sued her record label again over BTS’s song “Butter,” which her vocals are featured on. Megan was granted an injunction.</p><p>They say third time is the charm, so maybe this most recent lawsuit will finally end Megan’s working relationship with 1505 once and for all.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>‘Teen Mom 2’ Star Leah Messer New BF Proposed With 4-Carat Ring</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Pitchfork</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6prPAp2StoJWaerTAwK2gqKZdnsBuv9SipaBlmJq%2Fbr7EnKarnF2hrqOxy2adqKpdZnqutculoKimXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vontae-davis-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vontae Davis Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-antebellum-s-hillary-scott-gets-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Antebellum's Hillary Scott Gets Married!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
