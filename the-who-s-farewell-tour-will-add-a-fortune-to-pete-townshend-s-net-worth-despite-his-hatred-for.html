Sadly, since bassist John Entwistle died in 2002 and drummer Keith Moon passed away in 1978, only Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend are left. Over the years, fans have enjoyed seeing the two talented musicians perform live or watching them at The Super Bowl XLIV Halftime Show in 2010.</p><p>In March 2024, Pete Townshend was interviewed by The New York Times and said he<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thinks The Who should have a Farewell Tour</a></strong>. Since he has said that he doesn't love touring, this was an interesting statement.

In his interview with The New York Times, Pete Townshend said he <strong>would agree to a Farewell Tour with The Who in order to make money</strong>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Townshend has a $150 million net worth</strong></a>, and that number would likely increase from a final tour. Even though artists like <a href=#>Taylor Swift see their net worth grow after a Grammy win</a>, fans know that touring is where the real money is.</p><p>Since Townshend has explained that he has earned a lot from touring, he seems confident that one last tour would be a smart financial decision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pete-townshend.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He told The New York Times:</p><p>“It feels to me like there’s one thing the Who can do, and that’s a final tour where we play every territory in the world and then crawl off to die.

Fans would do everything in their power to secure tickets, and the tour would likely sell out fast.</p><p>In the same interview, he added that he doesn't enjoy going out on the road or live performances, but he has <strong>continued to </strong><strong>because he makes money</strong>. He said:</p><p>“I don’t get much of a buzz from performing with the Who. If I’m really honest, I’ve been touring for the money.

According to The Guardian, when he played at the Desert Trip California festival in 2016, he treated it as a job. He said, “I would be a liar if I said, ‘It was really fun, man. It was great!’ It wasn’t great. It was a gig. I did it and I got paid. The fact is, I don’t really like performing. But I’m good at it. I’m lucky to be good at something.

In an interview with USA Today, Daltrey explained that bands had a harder time earning money from tours after the COVID-19 pandemic. He said, "if you’re doing a 12-show run, you don’t start to earn it back until the seventh or eighth show." However, since Townshend floated the idea of a world tour, it sounds like he and Daltrey would have so many tour dates that they would definitely earn money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-pete-townshend-spend-his-earnings-from-touring-with-the-who>How Does Pete Townshend Spend His Earnings From Touring With The Who?</h2><p>Since Pete Townshend has made it clear that he goes out on tour because he earns money, not because he enjoys it, it's hard not to be curious about how he spends his tour earnings.
