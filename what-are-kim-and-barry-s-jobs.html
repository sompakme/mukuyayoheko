Like other famously large families, the Plaths are very different from the typical, mainstream American (and other places in the world!) family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim and Barry have&nbsp;nine children and apparently live in a remote area on a huge farm. The family shies away from technology and junk food, among other modern conventions. And yet it appears that they are somehow able to support all their kids without a paycheck from a reality show.</p><p>But fans wonder what it is the parents&nbsp;do to be able to afford such a large family. Do the parents commute hours away for their jobs? Does Kim even work?</p><p>Fans also query whether the Plaths have a similar net worth to another large reality TV family (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald have a surprising net worth</a>). Or perhaps they were barely scraping by and turned to TLC to make ends meet?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Welcome To Plathville': Where Does TLC&'s Plath Family Live?</a></span></p><p>The truth is that both the Plaths have careers. Or, at least, they did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woman's Day</a>&nbsp;says that&nbsp;Barry "has a job working as a transportation planner for a private firm where he's worked for 25 years." The job title can involve a range of duties, so there's no telling exactly what Barry does day-to-day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kim-Barry-Ethan-Plath-Welcome-to-Plathville.jpg><p>But the average salary for such a role ranges from the low $30Ks up to $100K or more. And after 25 years, it's safe to assume Barry has had quite a few raises. In short, it's entirely possible that Barry's got some significant savings — and plenty of cash to support his large family.</p><p>Of course, he really doesn't need a full-time income. That is, he didn't until recently.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YourTango</a> says that Kim is a "naturopathic doctor" and that she apparently saw patients out of her home office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though there aren't any hard facts to back up the claims&nbsp;YourTango made on behalf of Kim, if it's true that she's a medical practitioner, that probably made the family a decent income. Doctors tend to make bank, after all.</p><p>But for now, Kim's website is down, highlights&nbsp;YourTango, so it's tough to tell precisely what kind of medicine (non-medicine?) she practiced. Plus, not all practitioners have to have a degree, depending on what they're claiming to practice and where.</p><p>In reality, though, since Kim's still homeschooling her six younger kids, she's probably busy enough without juggling client appointments. Parents know the struggle of distance learning while trying to work remotely, so homeschooling kids while working out of the house can't be easy, either.</p><p>Besides, the family is making some amount of income from their time on TV, and the&nbsp;series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn't the most bizarre one TLC's ever done</a>. So the Plaths may no longer need day jobs one day soon!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Welcome To Plathville’: Who Is The Family's Eldest Daughter, Hosanna Plath?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiunqSTpLqmedOoZKmkkam1t7XLpZxmr5iWwW6t0Z5kpKGdYq%2BivtGyZKOnkqh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiger-woods-ex-wife-my-new-boyfriend-has-a-way-bigger-one.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiger Woods' Ex-Wife -- My New Boyfriend Has a WAY Bigger One</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./waka-flocka-explains-why-he-doesn-t-want-to-get-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Waka Flocka Explains Why He Doesnt Want to Get Married</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
