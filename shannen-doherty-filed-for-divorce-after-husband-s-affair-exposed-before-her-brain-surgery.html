I felt so betrayed.”</p><p>Shannen went on to thank her family and friends for helping her through her cancer treatment as well as the breakdown of her marriage.</p><p>“At the end of the day, I just felt so incredibly unloved by someone I was with for 14 years, by someone I loved with all my heart,” the actress said. “Just to have to go through all of that while trying to figure out if you’re going to get a f—king divorce and trying to get to the truth of that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shannen-says-she-rsquo-s-spoken-to-the-other-woman>Shannen Says She’s Spoken To The Other Woman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shannen-doherty-1.jpg><p>Also in the episode, Shannen admitted she’s spoken to the woman Kurt was cheating with, admitting she was “obsessed” with learning more about his affair. “If you share 14 years together and you cheated, doesn’t that person deserve the absolute truth regardless of how much that hurts them?” she explained.</p><p>“I am horrified that I can’t keep a relationship together. I think it is a reflection of me, but this one I think this one is on him. I’ve failed three times at marriage, but I still believe in love,” the actress continued. “I also take some responsibility for the demise of our marriage — actually that’s not true. Let me rephrase that, I do not take responsibility for the demise of our marriage, I take responsibility for some of the issues in our marriage. I take responsibility not only because of how I was but because of how cancer impacted my marriage and how it impacted him the second time around.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/beverly-hills-90210-shannen-doherty-jennie-garth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Beverly Hills 90210 Star Shannen Doherty Was Forced To Leave The Hit Show For A Different Reason Than Fans Think</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While fans have heard that Shannen Doherty was fired from Beverly Hills 90210 for bad behavior, why was she actually asked to quit the teen drama?</span><p>Shannen first revealed she was filing for divorce in April. The actress shared a short statement indicating divorce wasn’t what she wanted, but implying Kurt’s actions caused the split.</p><p>“Divorce is the last thing Shannen wanted,” Shannen’s rep said. “Unfortunately, she felt she was left with no other option.”</p><p>The former ‘90s it-girl has been battling cancer for nearly a decade. She first received a breast cancer diagnosis in 2015, but went into remission after two years of treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer returned in 2020 and has since revealed it’s in stage four.</p><p>Shannen and Kurt married in 2011.
