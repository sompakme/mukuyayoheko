Because while the rest of the world may have moved on, '90s kids can't forget about the group's legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the epic drama that went down between Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears to the songs the group penned about their split from former manager Lou Pearlman, and countless other scandals and hit tracks (plus their impressive choreography), there's just so much to love about the boy band that stole the world's heart.</p><p>But once the group broke up and Justin embarked on his solo career, it seemed like things had changed. JC Chasez headed out solo, too, but never reached the level of fame JT did.</p><p>Plus, some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin's comments have caused fans to wonder whether he's still close pals with bandmate Lance Bass</a>, which then leads to questioning the entire group's friendship status today.</p><p>And for Joey Fatone, who largely slid under the radar all these years, what's become of his connection to the boy band that made him an icon?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Does Justin Timberlake Make For Endorsements?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the guys of NSYNC might regret a lot of things about their past — like their '90s hairstyles</a> — they clearly don't regret the friendship they formed.</p><p>While Justin Timberlake seems less willing to relive his ramen-hair days than the rest of the group, the remaining members of NSYNC seem to love getting together for reunions every once in a while.</p><p>After all, what's 2020 without a little quaranSYNC?! But that's not the extent of the guys' reunion. Joey and Lance also got together on TikTok recently to poke fun at Chris; in their video, they recreate a throwback pic with a pineapple in place of Chris (and his '90s hair).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fatone also clearly embraces his history with the rest of his bandmates; he routinely posts memes (an NSYNC album photo with the guys wearing face masks and rebranded as NSIDE), wears "It's gonna be May" shirts, and pays tribute to his boy band days regularly.</p><p>Although, it's worth noting that while Joey is hanging out with celebs like Luis Fonsi, Guy Fieri, Nick Lachey, and Bret Michaels, he doesn't seem to be in touch with Justin Timberlake much. JC Chasez is also noticeably absent from his pics.</p><p>It's clear that while the NSYNC guys don't hate each other, some of them have more natural friendships than others. Lance and Joey, for example, tend to hang out a lot. JT&nbsp;does follow&nbsp;all the guys on IG though, which should placate fans.</p><p>But really, no one misses JT when Lance, Joey, and Chris are being hilarious together.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think Lance Bass Wins Instagram With Recent Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilrLGemHqqv4yjpp6xXZuutbvNnmSsrJmhuW6y0aKcp5yjYsSqwMdmmZqmlKKutbHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lindsey-vonn-and-19-other-attractive-female-olympians-travelling-to-korea-this-winter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lindsey Vonn And 19 Other Attractive Female Olympians Travelling To Korea This Winter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-why-twitter-is-talking-about-john-oliver-s-2018-comment-on-meghan-markle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Twitter Is Talking About John Oliver's 2018 Comment On Meghan Markle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beyonce-drops-new-my-house-song-to-celebrate-renaissance-film.html>Beyonce Drops New My House Song to Celebrate Renaissance Film</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./forgetting-sarah-marshall-cast-where-are-they-now.html>Forgetting Sarah Marshall Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-conway-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Tim Conways Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tink-net-worth-how-much-is-tink-worth.html>Tink Net Worth How Much Is Tink Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashSync.
