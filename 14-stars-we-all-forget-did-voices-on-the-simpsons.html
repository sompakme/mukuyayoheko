The beloved animated sitcom has used the voices of some of the biggest stars in Hollywood history.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Danny DeVito's Simpsons Role Changed The Show Forever</a></span>Many stars have played themselves on the show. Many others were more subtle with their performances than others. With so many characters, it's understandable that some forget these names have <a href=#>already been in some classic episodes</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-asner><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Ed Asner</span></h2><p>In season 11, episode 3, Homer gets a job as a food critic for the Springfield Shopper. His editor is played by the late TV legend and prominent activist Ed Asner. Asner played the paper's editor, <a href=#>an homage to his role in the show Lou Grant</a>.</p><h2 id=isabella-rossellini><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Isabella Rossellini</span></h2><p>Rossellini is Hollywood royalty as the daughter of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini, and her role in David Lynch's Blue Velvet secured her sultry on-screen appeal. She was thus brilliantly cast as Astrid Weller, an art dealer obsessed with Homer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willam-dafoe><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Willam Dafoe</span></h2><p>Dafoe's voice is one of the more recognizable to appear on the show, but he was still subtle in his performance as the commander of a military school in the season eight finale, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson." Lisa and Bart are sent to military school, where Lisa faces horrendous acts of sexism.</p><h2 id=steve-martin><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Steve Martin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's impossible for Steve Martin to not be funny, even when he plays the voice of reason and not one of his dim-witted characters. The star of Only Murders In The Building plays Ray Patterson, Springfield's sanitation commissioner who is ousted in an electoral coup by Homer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Creating Poochie Was The Simpsons' Actively Rebelling Against Invasive Network Notes</a></span></p><h2 id=mel-gibson><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mel Gibson</span></h2><p>Before his scandals, Mel Gibson was one of the most in-demand actors in the film industry. Thus he played off of his celebrity in season 11's premiere episode "Beyond Blunderdome." The revolves around Mel doing an artistic remake of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, which Homer and he reshot to have Mr. Smith go on a killing spree at the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-mckean><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Michael McKean</span></h2><p>Before he was Chuck on Better Call Saul, Michael McKean<a href=#> was already one of the most accomplished comedians of the 80s and 90s.</a> He was a key member of This is Spinal Tap and returned to that role for an episode in season 3. He returned again in season 10 to play shock-jock Jerry Rude in the episode "Monty Can't Buy Me Love." The episode ends with Mr. Burns stealing the Loch Ness Monster and putting him to work in a casino.</p><h2 id=michelle-pfeiffer><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Michelle Pfeiffer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In season 5 she plays Mindy, a new coworker of Homer's at the nuclear plant who has far more in common with him than Marge. Homer becomes tempted to cheat on Marge. In the end, we all know Homer could never go through with it, and the show concludes with Homer and Marge in each other's arms, before Homer punches a pervy bellhop.</p><h2 id=jackie-mason><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jackie Mason</span></h2><p>The iconic comedian was also<a href=#> in one of the show's most famous episodes</a>. In season 3, we learn that Krusty The Clown was disowned by his father for becoming an entertainer instead of a rabbi. The notoriously fast-talking Jackie Mason plays Rabbi Hershel Krustofski, Krusty's estranged father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=winona-ryder><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Winona Ryder</span></h2><p>Before her shoplifting scandal, Winona Ryder seemed like she was everywhere in the '90s, so of course, she eventually made her way to The Simpsons.

Hoffman plays Lisa's well-versed, deeply caring substitute teacher in the episode, again aptly titled, "Lisa's Substitute" in season 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=susan-sarandon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Susan Sarandon</span></h2><p>Sarandon is a great actress, even when she is not on the screen. Sarandon plays Bart's ballet teacher for the B-plot of the episode "Homer Vs. Patty and Selma." Bart pursues ballet with vigor but fears Nelson and the bullies will beat him up if they find out.</p><h2 id=jeff-goldblum><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jeff Goldblum</span></h2><p>Goldblum can be seen in the episode "A Fish Called Selma."

But at the height of his fame, before any scandal, Jackson came on and was the voice of "Michael Jackson" a big tall white mental patient who was really named Leon Kompowsky. The episode was titled "Stark Raving Dad" and it was the debut episode for season 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiqHq4tM5mm6KcXau8qq%2FErGSopl2ptaZ50qKkqaufo8Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-facts-we-didn-t-know-about-misty-from-pokemon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Facts We Didn't Know About Misty From Pokemon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-religion-does-larry-elder-follow-know-all-about-the-california-recall-candidate-amid-finances.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Religion Does Larry Elder Follow?
