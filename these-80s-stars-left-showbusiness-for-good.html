Johnny Depp is a prime example; He started as a heartthrob in the TV show 21 Jump Street and quickly became one of the most successful actors of his generation. But not every star who was big in the '80s has stayed in the spotlight. Fame is fickle and tiring, and these stars from the decade of Ronald Reagan, leg warmers, Alf, and scrunchies, have opted out after making it big.</p><p><strong>Updated on May 5, 2023:</strong> Many stars of the 80s are indeed making a rise as nostalgia is being capitalized in current entertainment. Among all the stars on this list, however, there are only two that have publicized their plans to continue their craft in 2023. Tiffany Darwish is still touring this year, performing her music, and Rick Moranis will be acting in an upcoming film called Shrunk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=haviland-morris-became-a-real-estate-agent><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Haviland Morris Became A Real Estate Agent</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/haviland-morris-in-sixteen-candles.jpg><p>One will most likely recognize Haviland Morris as Caroline Munford from Sixteen Candles.
